Then we will look at the various sorting algorithms. Then we will move to leetcode problems covering easy, medium \u0026amp; hard problems. Then we will move to concurrency problems, how atomic variable work, how locks work etc. Then we will cover some SQL and database queries. The problems solved here are concise \u0026amp; small making it easy to understand and revise. All problems solved here are developed with test driven approach, with various test that can be run locally. Each of the solutions follow certain pattern. Eg: if you learn back-tracking solution in one problem the pattern is similar when you solve it in other problem. This is very important when it comes to the learning aspect. Most problems have a parent problem, Once you solve this parent problem you can solve various subset or variation of this problem. Such problems are grouped as similar in the solutions. Approach To Solve Given a problem here are some questions that should help you figure out the general direction of how to solve it\nWhich data structure can I use? Arrays, LinkedList, HashMap, Heap, Tree, or Trie Do I need to use 2 data structures? eg: LRU How do I break the problem into smaller units, is there a problem within a problem, can i write a decision tree? Does this problem look similar to other problems you have solved? Will sorting make the problem easier to solve? Can I use any algorithmic techniques, like bfs, dfs, two pointer etc. Do any design patterns apply that could make it easier to maintain, like observer pattern? What is the time \u0026amp; space complexity? Best case, worst case time complexity? Average case is usually difficult to derive. Tips\nLinked list problems often use a dummy node. To delete a node in the link list you need previous node or be position one node behind. Time complexity is O(number of branches ^ n) In-order traversal of BST results in ascending order array. BFS requires a queue, DFS requires recursion. If the char set is bound to 26 chars, use char[26] array instead of Map or Set. Algo Techniques Sorting Map \u0026amp; Set Recursion Fast pointer \u0026amp; Slow pointer Min-Heap vs Max-Heap (Priority Queue) Binary search BFS vs DFS Two Pointers Sliding Window Fast pointer vs Slow pointer Backtracking Matrix Prefix sum Divide \u0026amp; Conquer Memoization / Dynamic programming Greedy Topological Sort Intervals Cyclic Sort Bitwise XOR / Bit manipulation Trie Stacks \u0026amp; Queue Big-O 1log(n) \u0026lt; √(n) \u0026lt; n \u0026lt; nlog(n) \u0026lt; n^2 \u0026lt; n^3 \u0026lt; 2^n \u0026lt; n!

Thread Pool Size cpu intensive = num of cores io intensive = time it takes for IO to complete. ideal thread pool size = cores * (1 + (wait time/cpu time)) https://youtu.be/ErNre5varF8\nTypes of ExecutorService ExecutorService uses BlockingQueue by default newFixedThreadPool - LinkedBlockingQueue newSingleThreadExecutor newCachedThreadPool - SynchronousQueue, dynamically scale the threads to handle the amount of tasks, threads are idle for 60 second, they will be scaled down Rejection policy AbortPolicy - This is the default policy. It causes the executor to throw a RejectedExecutionException. CallerRunsPolicy - the producer thread will be employed to run the task it just submitted. This is effective back pressure. DiscardOldestPolicy - accept the task and throw away the oldest task in the BlockingQueue DiscardPolicy - accept the task but silently throw it away Custom Policy - We can implement the RejectedExecutionHandler interface and provide our own logic to handle Mutex vs Semaphore Mutex (or Mutual Exclusion Semaphores) is a locking mechanism used to synchronize access to a resource. Only one task can acquire the mutex. It means there will be ownership associated with mutex, and only the owner can release the lock (mutex). Semaphore (or Binary Semaphore) is signaling mechanism (“I am done, you can carry on” kind of signal). A binary semaphore is NOT protecting a resource from access. Semaphores are more suitable for some synchronization problems like producer-consumer. Short version:\nMutex can be released only by the thread that had acquired it. Binary Semaphore can be signaled by any thread (or process). Read vs Write lock Read Lock – if no thread acquired the write lock or requested for it then multiple threads can acquire the read lock Write Lock – if no threads are reading or writing then only one thread can acquire the write lock\nConcurrency CyclicBarrier - CyclicBarriers are used in programs in which we have a fixed number of threads that must wait for each other to reach a common point before continuing execution.

Functional requirements What is the start \u0026amp; end result/state? Is this is a live service or a background service? Does this need stream processing or batch processing? How many users? Does the data need to be persisted? Does the data need to be consistent? Does the service need external API? Does the service need role based authentication/authorization? 2. Non-Functional requirements What is the latency expected? What is the fault tolerance criteria? What is load the system needs to handle and scale requirements? What observability \u0026amp; monitoring is needed by the system? What is the uptime \u0026amp; availability SLA? What security aspects need to be addressed? Does it need auditing \u0026amp; reporting? 3. Capacity planning How many servers would you need? How many users (load) are going to access the service? How much storage is required?

It's a 30,000 foot view of the system that covers what the various components of the systems and how they interact with each other. The objective here is to come up with various sub-systems and modules and identify how they will interact with each other. Eg: Design Food Delivery App, Design Uber, Design Twitter.\nComponent diagrams Sequence diagrams Use-cases API Interaction Low Level Design (LLD) Low Level Design (LLD) involves picking a specific module/sub-system from the HLD and doing a deep dive into its implementations. The problem statement is more detailed and outcome is clear. Eg: Design the order acceptance system for food delivery app that can cater to 7-10K requests per hour.\nEntity Relationship diagrams Decision tree/Flow chart Class diagrams Swim-lane diagrams Fundamentals 1. Short-Polling vs Long-Polling vs SSE (Server Sent Events) vs Websocket Short-Polling - Client continuously asks the server for new data. Long-Polling - Client continuously asks the server for new data, but server waits for a few seconds and if data becomes available by then it will return the data. Websocket - HTTP connection is upgraded to bidirectional connection. Server Sent Events - HTTP connection is kept open by the server and data is pushed to client continuously over it. Websocket Server Sent Event Long-Poll Type Of Channel Full-duplex,Bidirectional Half-duplex,Unidirectional Half-duplex,Unidirectional Type of Client Server Push \u0026amp; Client Send Server Push Client Pull Type of Data Text + Binary Text Text + Binary Connection Limit 65,536 (max number of TCP ports) 6-8 parallel per domain Based on threads available https://youtu.be/ZBM28ZPlin8\n2. Fork Join Pool Fork Join is suited for tasks that create sub-tasks. Fork/Join framework uses work-stealing algorithm. Work stealing is a scheduling strategy where worker threads that have finished their own tasks can steal pending tasks from other threads. Uses a deque (double ended queue), main thread picks task from the front of the queue, other threads steal tasks from the back of the queue.\n1 2@RequiredArgsConstructor 3class FibForkJoin extends RecursiveTask\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; { 4 final int n; 5 6 @Override 7 protected Integer compute() { 8 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Current Thread: \u0026#34; + Thread.currentThread().getName() + \u0026#34; n = \u0026#34; + n); 9 if (n \u0026lt;= 1) { 10 return n; 11 } 12 FibForkJoin f1 = new FibForkJoin(n - 1); 13 f1.fork(); 14 FibForkJoin f2 = new FibForkJoin(n - 2); 15 f2.fork(); 16 return f1.join() + f2.join(); 17 } 18} https://youtu.be/5wgZYyvIVJk\n3. Distributed Transaction The best thing to do is completely avoid distributed transactions. As it makes the system complex to manage. However, if that is not possible.\nTwo phase (prepare \u0026amp; commit) - Blocking protocol as it waits for the prepare-ack for prepare phase. Three phase commit (prepare, pre-commit \u0026amp; commit) - Non-Blocking protocol as first phase gathers votes and only the second phase blocks with timeout. Saga - A sequence of transactions that updates each service and publishes a message or event to trigger the next transaction step. https://youtu.be/jGJT1FRYGcY\nhttps://youtu.be/S4FnmSeRpAY\n4. Saga Pattern A sequence of transactions that updates each service and publishes a message or event to trigger the next transaction step. Each local transaction updates the database and publishes a message/event to trigger the next local transaction in another service. If a local transaction fails then the saga executes a series of compensating transactions that undo the changes that were made by the preceding transactions.\nThe 2 approaches\nChoreography - Each local transaction publishes domain events that trigger local transactions in other services. Orchestration - An orchestrator tells the participants what local transactions to execute. Problems with saga\nHard to debug \u0026amp; test. Risk of cyclic dependency between saga participants. 5. Isolation Levels Data Consistency\nDirty reads: read UNCOMMITED data from another transaction. Non-repeatable reads: read COMMITTED data from an UPDATE query from another transaction. Phantom reads: read COMMITTED data from an INSERT or DELETE query from another transaction. Dirty Read\nNAME AGE Bob 35 TRANSACTION T1 TRANSACTION T2 select age from table where name = 'Bob'; (35) update table set age = 40 where name = 'Bob'; select age from table where name = 'Bob'; (40) commit; Non-Repeatable Read\nNAME AGE Bob 35 TRANSACTION T1 TRANSACTION T2 select age from table where name = 'Bob'; (35) update table set age = 40 where name = 'Bob'; commit; select age from table where name = 'Bob'; (40) Phantom Read\nNAME AGE Bob 35 TRANSACTION T1 TRANSACTION T2 select count(*) from table where age = 35; (1) insert into table values ('jack', 35); commit; select count(*) from table where age = 35; (2) To prevent the following read issues, 4 isolation levels are provided\nISOLATION-LEVEL DIRTY-READ NON-REPEATABLE-READ PHANTOM-READ READ_UNCOMMITED YES YES YES READ_COMMITED NO YES YES READ_REPEATABLE NO NO YES READ_SERIALIZABLE NO NO NO In Spring JPA you can use isolation level on transactions or the whole session.\n1@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.SERIALIZABLE) 6. Indexing Database indexes help improve the speed and efficiency of querying data in a database\nClustered index - A special type of index that reorders the way records in the table are physically stored. Therefore, table can have only one clustered index. The leaf nodes of a clustered index contain the data pages. eg: primary key Non-clustered index - A special type of index in which the logical order of the index does not match the physical stored order of the rows on disk. The leaf node of a non-clustered index does not consist of the data pages. Instead, the leaf nodes contain index rows. eg: unique constraints Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index\nClustered Index Non-Clustered Index Faster Slower Requires less memory Requires more memory Index leaf node is the main data Index leaf node is pointer to data Table can have only one clustered index Table can have multiple non-clustered index Each new index will increase the time it takes to write new records. The where clause should have columns which are indexed for the right index to be used. The like clause doesn't use index column because it's a match query. If you want to explicitly use certain index you can use hints.The db query executor can choose to use it but there are no guarantees. To explain the plan\n1EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table; To execute and explain the plan\n1EXPLAIN ANALYZE * FROM table; Tradeoff\nStorage Space: Indexes consume additional storage space, as they create and maintain separate data structures alongside the original table data. Write Performance: When data is inserted, updated, or deleted in a table, the associated indexes must also be updated, which can slow down write operations. https://youtu.be/-qNSXK7s7_w\n7. Vertical Scaling vs Horizontal Scaling Vertical scaling you increase/add resources like more memory, cpu etc. Horizontal scaling you add more servers. 8. Datacenter Overview of a datacenter layout\nEach Availability zone is plugged to a different power supply, cooling, networking. Availability Set each set is on a separate server rack (fault domain). Failure affects only few racks. Paired region allows replication across multiple region. eg: Zone1 of RegionA is paired with Zone1 of RegionB Grouping of Availability Set:\nFault domain - Grouping of servers based on rack (power, network input). Update domain - Grouping of servers based on which group can be powered on/off. Outages:\nIf there is a wire cut in the rack availability set is down. If there is a fire in one-floor/one-building of the datacenter then one zone is down, other floors/building in same region are isolated hence remain operational. If there is a hurricane in the region cutting all power then all zones in that region are down. 9. Distributed System \u0026amp; Microservices Distributed system\nCharacteristics of distributed system\nFailure - Always assume that things will fail and plan for it. Eg: Network failures, Disk failures Circuit Breaker Pattern - Instead of throwing error page handle service down gracefully. Service Discovery - All services register themselves making it easy to lookup services. Observability - System is actively monitored. Fail-Over - Stand by server go live when primary servers dies. Throughput - The number of requests the system can process. Latency - Time taken to process the requests. Rate Limit - Restrict overuse of services by single or many users. Caching - Caching speeds up lookup however can bring in-consistency among caches. Bulk head pattern - Failure in one system should not bring down the whole system. Timeout - Ensure proper connection timeouts are set so that slow downstream service cant impact upstream service. Fail-fast - Prefer to fail fast than deal with slow latency, as it can cascade the effect in upstream services. Fault Tolerance - Ability to deal with failure in system. eg: Chaos Monkey - Randomly turn off systems to ensure system is fault-tolerant. Retry - Systems can come up or go down, have ability to retry once it recovers. Data durability \u0026amp; Consistency - failure rates of storage, corruption rate in read-write process Replication - backing up data, active replication vs passive replication. High-Availability - If downtime are not acceptable then system should always be up. Trade-Offs - Every choice comes with its shortcoming be aware of it. Scaling - System should be able to cope with increased and decreased load. Microservices\nMicroservices is an architectural style where applications are structured as a collection of small, loosely-coupled, and independently deployable services. Each microservice is responsible for a specific piece of functionality within the application \u0026amp; communicates with other microservices through well-defined APIs\nCharacteristics of microservices\nSingle Responsibility: Specific functionality, Makes the services easier to understand, develop, and maintain. Independence: Develop, deploy, and scale services independently of one another. Loose coupling. Decentralized: Each service owns its data and business logic. Each service has its own database. Communication: Communicate with each other using lightweight protocols such as HTTP/REST, gRPC, or message queues. Fault Tolerance: Failure in one service does not necessarily cause the entire system to fail. Improves resiliency. 10. Caching Advantages of Caching\nImproves performance of application Reduces latency Reduces load on the DB Reduces network cost Increases Read Throughput. However, it does come with its own cost/problems like cache invalidation, stale data, high churn if TTL (time-to-live) is set wrong, thundering herd etc. A distributed cache (read-write) comes with problems of its own like consistency, node affinity etc.\nDifferent places to cache\nClient side caching - When the client or browser can cache some data to avoid the external call. Server side caching - Each server can cache some data locally. Global/Distributed caching - A centralized server/service to cache data. Proxy/Gateway side caching - Proxy or gateway servers cache some data so the request can be returned immediately without reaching out to backend. 11. Types of Cache Spatial cache - Locality based cache, bring all nearby associated data from disk to cache. Eg: If fetching user profile also load user rating to cache. Temporal cache - Cache stores elements that are frequently used. Eg: LRU Distributed cache - Cache spread across many nodes, keeping cache in sync with store is important. https://youtu.be/ccemOqDrc2I\n12. Cache Store On-Heap Store - stores cache entries in Java heap memory Off-Heap Store - primary memory (RAM) to store cache entries, cache entries will be moved to the on-heap memory automatically before they can be used. Disk Store - uses a hard disk to store cache entries. SSD type disk would perform better. Clustered Store - stores cache entries on the remote server 13. Cache Eviction Policies FIFO (First In First Out) - replaces first element that was added to the cache. eg: queue LIFO (Last In First Out) - replaces the last element that was added to the cache. eg: stack LRU (Least Recently Used) - replaces element that has not been used for the longest time. eg: frequently accessed item based on timestamp remain in cache MRU (Most Recently Used) - replaces most recently used elements. LFU (Least Frequently Used) - replaces least frequently used elements based on count. eg: frequently accessed item based on count remain in cache RR (Random Replacement) - replaces elements randomly. 14. Caching Strategy Read heavy caching strategies\nRead-Cache-Aside - Application queries the cache. If the data is found, it returns the data directly. If not it fetches the data from the SoR (store-of-record), stores it into the cache, and then returns. Read-Through - Application queries the cache, cache service queries the SoR if not present and updates the cache and returns. Write heavy caching strategies\nWrite-Around - Application writes to db and to the cache. Write-Behind / Write-Back - Application writes to cache. Cache is pushed to SoR after some delay periodically. Write-Through - Application writes to cache, cache service immediately writes to SoR. 15. High Availability Deployment Active-Active - Two nodes of the service running in parallel, loadbalancer will route traffic to both. Active-Passive - The primary and secondary service running in parallel, with primary serving all the requests. If primary fails loadbalancer will route traffic to secondary and designate it as primary. 16. CDN \u0026amp; Edge Servers Content Delivery Network (CDN) reduce latency by keeping static content closer to the customer regions. Always remember to version your static content like css, images etc to help CDN differentiate between versions.\nPush CDN - Developer pushes the static content to CDN Pull CDN - First request pulls the static content to the CDN Edge Servers run compute operations closer to the customer region, eg: Streaming, Gaming etc.\n17. Message Broadcast Protocols Tell Everyone Everything - Too much traffic noise. Gossip - No guarantee that message has reached everyone. Distributed Cache - External entity required. Co-ordination service - Co-ordination appoints one person to inform everyone. Leader Election - Service appoints leaders in the group whose job is to inform them of any changes. 18. Kafka Kafka is a distributed \u0026amp; fault-tolerant, high throughput, scalable stream processing \u0026amp; messaging system.\nKafka as publisher-subscriber messaging system. Kafka as queue (point-point) messaging system. Kafka as stream processing system that reacts to event in realtime. Kafka as a store for data. Terms\nBroker: Kafka server Topic: Logical grouping of partition, data stream. Partition: Messages are stored in a partition. A topic can contain many partitions. Offset: Used to keep track of message. Consumer: Client application that processes message from a partition. Consumer Group: Group of consumers Order is guaranteed only withing a partition and not across partitions. Within a consumer group a partition can be read only by one consumer. Leader replicates partition to other replica servers based on replication count. If leader fails then follower will become leader. Zookeeper manages all brokers, keeps track of offset, consumer group, topic, paritions etc. Once a message acknowledgement fails kafka will retry and even after certain retries if it fails, the message will be moved to dead letter. Kafka provides high throughput because of the following\nKafka scales because it works on append only mode, sequential disk write is faster than random access file write Kafka copies data from disk to network by ready with zero copy. OS buffer directly copies to NIC buffer. There is no set limit to the number of topics that can exist in a Kafka cluster, each partition has a limit of 4000 partitions per broker, maximum 200,000 partitions per Kafka cluster\nhttps://gitorko.github.io/post/spring-apache-kafka/\nhttps://youtu.be/Cie5v59mrTg\nhttps://youtu.be/UNUz1-msbOM\nKafka Use-Cases\nActivity tracking for high traffic website Processing streaming big data Monitoring financial data in real time IoT sensor data processing 19. RabbitMQ RabbitMQ is a distributed message-broker that support various message protocols.\nAMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) STOMP (Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) Models of communication\nQueue - Message published once \u0026amp; consumed once. Pub-Sub - Message published once consumed many times Retry Mechanism\nAuto-Ack - Broker will delete message after delivering it to consumer. Doesn't wait till consumer processes it. Manual-Ack - Broker will delete message only after consumer acknowledges processing it. After certain retry if it still fails then rejected messages will move to dead letter queue.\nRabbitMQ Distributed Setup\nCluster - Exchanges replicate to all servers. , all nodes need same version. Support bi-direction. Federation - Exchange on one broker publishes to an exchange on another. Many brokers on different version. Supports both uni and bi direction. Shovel plugin - similar to federation but works at low level. Difference\nCluster Federation Single logical broker Many brokers All nodes on same version All nodes on different version Bi-Direction topology Uni-Direction or Bi-Direction topology CP System (CAP) AP System (CAP) RabbitMQ vs Kafka\nRabbitMQ Kafka Push model Pull model Consumed event deleted, Less storage All events stored, More storage required Queues are single threaded Can scale based on consumer groups Smart broker (routing key) \u0026amp; Dumb Consumer Dumb broker \u0026amp; Smart Consumer (partition aware) No events replay Events can be read from any point Ordering guaranteed Ordering guaranteed only within partition https://www.upsolver.com/blog/kafka-versus-rabbitmq-architecture-performance-use-case\nhttps://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/blog/understanding-the-differences-between-rabbitmq-vs-kafka/\nhttps://youtu.be/O1PgqUqZKTA\n20. Redis Redis is an in-memory data store. Reading/writing to RAM is always faster than disk, hence it has high throughput and low latency. Redis employs a single-threaded architecture. Redis supports Non-blocking IO. Redis can deliver up to 1 million requests per second when run on an average Linux system.\nLimitation is that dataset cant be larger than memory (RAM)\nSince redis is single threaded there is no need for lock, no need for thread synchronization, no context switching, no time spent to create or destroy threads. It doesn't need multi thread because it uses I/O multiplexing where a single thread can wait on many socket connections for read/write. Redis cluster can be scaled even more with sharding.\nDatastructures supported\nString - (SDS, simple dynamic string) BitMap BitField Hash - (Hash Table, Zip List) List - (Link List, Zip List) Set - (Hash Table, IntSet) Sorted Set - (Skip List) Geospatial Hyperlog Stream Redis Use-Cases\nCaching Session store Gaming leaderboards (SortedSet) Rate limiting (INCR - Counter \u0026amp; Setting TTL) Distributed Lock (SETNX - SET if Not exists) https://youtu.be/5TRFpFBccQM\n21. Stream processing vs Message processing Message Processing Stream Processing Messages are removed from queue after processing Append only log which can be processed from any point again No concept of windowing Data within a window matters, window can be 1 day, 1 year etc Push based Pull based Waits for ACK on delivery after push No need to wait for ACK as its pull based Slow consumer can lead to build up of queue Data is written to logs and read from logs Order not guaranteed Order guaranteed (within log partition) No downstream adapters Adapters provide options to route to other downstream endpoints eg: database https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2021/07/rabbitmq-streams-overview\n22. JVM Memory \u0026amp; Garbage collectors In java memory allocated to program is cleaned up and recovered by the garbage collector. If this doesn't happen then your program will run out of memory space to execute. Garbage collection provides automation memory management in java. Objects are created on the heap in java.\nJava Memory Model:\nHeap:\nJava heap memory is partitioned to young generation \u0026amp; old generation. New objects reside in young generation. Objects that reside long are moved to old generation. Once young generation is full the objects are moved to old generation. (Generational garbage collection) Once old generation is also full (threshold reached) major GC is triggered. Non-Heap (Perm-gen)\nMetadata of classes and methods are stored in perm-gen. Since java 8 perm-gen is replaced by metaspace. Metaspace is automatically resized hence applications won't run out of memory if the classes are big. Garbage collection runs in 2 phases:\nMinor GC - Happens on Young generation. Major GC - Happens on Old generation. Stop of the world event, program pauses till memory is cleaned. Least pause time is always preferred. Algorithms:\nMark-Copy - Happens in Young generation. Marks all live objects Then copies from eden space to survivor space (S1/S2), At any given point either S1 or S2 is always empty. Then entire eden space is treated as empty. Mark-Sweep-Compact - Happens in Old generation. Marks all live objects. Sweep/Reclaim all dead object. Releases memory. Compaction - Move all live objects to left so that are next to each other in continuous block. Types of Garbage Collector:\nSerial collector - Single thread for both minor \u0026amp; major gc. Parallel collector - Multiple thread for both minor \u0026amp; single/multiple thread for major gc. Doesn't run concurrently with application. The pause time is longest. CMS collector - Multiple thread for both minor \u0026amp; major gc. Concurrent Mark \u0026amp; Sweep. Runs concurrently with application to mark live objects. The pause time is minimal. CPU intensive. G1 collector - Garbage first collector. Entire heap is divided to multiple regions that can be resized. A region can be young or old. The pause time is predictable as regions are small. Epsilon collector - Do nothing collector. JVM shutsdown once heap is full. Used for zero pause time application provided memory is planned. Shenandoah collector - Similar to G1, but runs concurrently with application. CPU intensive. ZGC collector - Applications run while GC is performed. Lowest pause time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AZ0KKeXJSo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXOaCV5xm9s\n23. Proxy vs Reverse-Proxy Proxy or forward proxy - Takes the connection out. Client is hidden. Reverse proxy - Brings the connection in. Server is hidden. 24. Load Balancer Software based eg: Nginx Hardware based eg: F5 Load balancer distributes traffic across multiple nodes ensuring high availability. Always create health check url that can determine if node is healthy or not, based on this the load balancer decides if the node is up or down.\nL3 - IP Based L4 - DNS Based L7 - Application Based Sticky sessions - Will assign the same user request to the same node in order to maintain the session state on the node. Ideally sticky session should be avoided, if the node goes down few users will experience outage. However in some cases sticky session will be easy to configure and setup.\n25. Load Balancer Routing Algorithms Round-robin - traffic distributed in round-robin fashion. Weighted Round-robin - traffic distributed by weight, some servers may be able to process more load hence their weight is more compared to smaller configuration machines. Least Connections - traffic is sent to server with the fewest current connections to clients. Least Response Time - traffic is sent to server with the fastest response time. Least Bandwidth - traffic is sent to server with the least Mbps of traffic. Hashing - traffic is sent to server based on a hash key. eg: client IP address hash, request URL hash. 26. NoSQL vs Relational DB NoSQL RDBMS Non-Relational DB Relational DB No predefined schema, handles un-structured data Require a schema, handles structured data Can scale across machines Cant scale across machines easily BASE Principle of eventual consistency ACID properties Structure can be Key-Value pairs, Document, Graph, Wide column Structure is Table based 27. CQRS - Command and Query Responsibility Segregation Pattern that separates read and update operations for a data store. Implementing CQRS in your application can maximize its performance, scalability, and security\n28. HTTP1 vs HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 vs HTTP3 Protocol HTTP1 - one tcp connection per request HTTP1.1 - one tcp connection per request, keep alive connection so connection is not closed immediately. HTTP2 - one tcp connection for all requests. Multiplex all requests on one TCP. Server Push where the server proactively pushes css,js all on one TCP when the server requests the html file. HTTP3 - Uses QUIC protocol (based on UDP). Eg: Mobile that is changing cell towers, UDP continues to stream data without a new TCP handshake with the new tower. https://youtu.be/a-sBfyiXysI\n29. HTTPS \u0026amp; TLS Handshake Asymmetric encryption vs symmetric encryption\n30. Thundering Herd Problem When large number of request hit a server and cache doesn't contain the required data, lot time is spent going back and forth to update the cache, this can overwhelm the backend causing an outage which is called the thundering herd problem. To address this issue fail fast and update the cache after some random delay.\n31. Tsunami Traffic A streaming service is hosting a sports event. Millions of users suddenly login to watch the game as the game reaches the end causes a sudden surge in traffic.\nScaling up services takes time, Keep few services on standby if you anticipate heavy traffic. Configure auto-scaling based on key parameters. Scale on concurrent requests \u0026amp; not on CPU or memory usage. Design for scale down models as well along with scale up. Identify breaking point for each system. Plan for service denial via circuit breakers for new customers instead of system wide outage for all customers. 32. Serverless / FAAS (Function As A Service) Function is exposed as a service. Cost optimal, pay for only what you use. 33. Bloom filter Bloom filter is a probabilistic algorithm. Determines if given element is present in a set or not (member of set). In some cases it can give false positive, but will never give a false negative. More hash functions you use lesser the collisions, wider the bit array lesser the collisions. It is space efficient as it uses less memory.\nTo determine 'Member of set' No false negative but can give false positive Less memory used, entire bloom filter result can be sent over wire. Probabilistic algorithm Bloom Filter Use-Cases\nMalicious url detection in browser via bloom filter. CDN cache url, cache page only if 2nd request (member of set). Weak password detection. Username already taken. Cache only on 2nd request https://youtu.be/Bay3X9PAX5k\nhttps://youtu.be/V3pzxngeLqw\n34. Count-Min Sketch Count-Min Sketch is a probabilistic algorithm. Count frequency of event in streaming data, uses multiple hash to map frequency on to a matrix. Uses less space. In some cases it can over count due to hash collision but never under-count the events.\nCount frequency of events, range query, total, percentile. Uses less memory. Probabilistic algorithm. Every event is passed via multiple hash functions and respective matrix row/column updated. The frequency is determined by the minimum of all these counts. For more accuracy you can add more hash functions and wider column. In the example below hash generates numbers 0-6. Lesser hash functions will result in more collisions.\nhttps://youtu.be/ibxXO-b14j4\n35. BitMap Bit Array, Uses less memory Each bit holds value Using AND / OR operation can merge many bitmaps Eg: Daily site visitor count.\nhttps://youtu.be/8ZgRW0DNus4\n36. Locks \u0026amp; Contention Avoid locks if you want to scale, as they cause contention around shared resources Do pre-work instead of on-demand if it avoids contention. Eg: Issue 1 Billion tickets, instead of updating a row in DB with locks/syncronization, load a queue with all 1 Billion tickets and users can pick from queue. 37. Paxos \u0026amp; Raft To achieve Consensus over distribute system we use either paxos or raft algorithms.\nPaxos - Allows system to reach consensus based on majority votes. There are 2 ways to configure paxos\nNon-Leader - Client can send proposal, based on votes the consensus is reached. Since there is a lot of concurrency it can lead to conflicts/live-locks which is inefficient. Leader (Multi-Paxos) - Only one leader can send proposal, hence no live-locks present. Uses a ledger book to store requests in-case leader goes down. Highest server id will be the leader. Raft - Allows system to reach consensus based on what the leader says. After certain timeout the election for leader is held again. Each node stores a log (state information) that is replicated from the leader. Each node holds number of terms it has served as leader. If 2 systems get same votes during election, they will again carry out an election.\neg: Consul, etcd, Zookeeper\nhttps://youtu.be/fcFqFfsAlSQ\n38. CAP Theorem C - Consistency A - Availability P - Partition Tolerance CA System - Single Node MySql, Oracle CP System - Zookeeper AP System - Apache Couchbase, Cassandra https://youtu.be/KmGy3sU6Xw8\n39. ACID vs BASE transactions ACID\nAtomicity - All changes to data are performed as if they are a single operation, either all succeed or all fail. Consistency - Data is in a consistent state when a transaction starts and when it ends. Isolation - The intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other transactions. Durability - Data persisted survives even if system restarted. BASE\nBasically Available - System guarantees availability. Soft State - The state of the system may change over time, even without input. Replication can take time so till then state is in soft-state. Eventual Consistency - The system will become consistent over a period of time 40. Database Scaling Read scaling - Replication, All writes goto one db node, which gets replicated to all read node db. (eventual consistency) Write scaling - Sharding 41. Partition vs Sharding Partitioning - Breaks up data into many smaller blocks within the same database server. Client need not be aware of partitions. Horizontal partition - Based on key the data is split. eg: All records for 2021 get written to partition_2021, all 2022 records get written to partition_2022 Vertical partition - Based on some column the data is split. eg: All the image blob of a profile are stored in a different table. Sharding - Breaks up data into many smaller blocks in different database servers. Client must be aware of shards. Cant do transactions or joins across shards. If data distribution is not uniform then will have to re-balance shards. eg: All customer records A-H go to database server1, all records I-Z go to database server2. When to Partition?\nWhen the table is too big for even indexes to search. Partition bring in improvement in query performance. When you need to purge old records as part of data management. Easier to drop partition than delete rows. Bulk loads and data deletion can be done much faster, as these operations can be performed on individual partitions. When to Shard?\nTo scale out horizontally. When there are too many writes. When data is transaction isolated, and you don't need to join across shards. If data is uniformly distributed among shards then query load is also equally distributed. Sharding on postgres using postgres_fdw extension.\n1CREATE TABLE customer 2( 3 id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL, 4 name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, 5 city_id INT NOT NULL, 6 created_on TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, 7); 8 9CREATE 10EXTENSION postgres_fdw; 11GRANT USAGE ON FOREIGN 12DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw to app_user; 13CREATE 14SERVER shard02 FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw 15 OPTIONS (dbname \u0026#39;postgres\u0026#39;, host \u0026#39;shard02\u0026#39;, port \u0026#39;5432\u0026#39;); 16CREATE 17USER MAPPING for app_user SERVER shard02 OPTIONS (user \u0026#39;app_username\u0026#39;, password \u0026#39;app_password\u0026#39;); 18 19CREATE 20FOREIGN TABLE customer_2021 PARTITION OF customer 21 FOR VALUES FROM (\u0026#39;2021-01-01\u0026#39;) TO (\u0026#39;2021-12-31\u0026#39;) 22 SERVER remoteserver01; 42.

Bulkhead pattern If one microservice is slow it can end up blocking threads and there by affecting all other microservices. Solution is to have dedicated thread pool for each client. It isolates dependencies, so that problem in one dependency doesn't affect others. A counter can also be used with max limits instead of creating different thread pool. Fail-Fast is preferred over slow service.\nIf the cart service is not-responding the threads will be blocked and waiting, since the thread pool is different the problem is isolated.\nhttps://youtu.be/R2FT5edyKOg\n44. Circuit Breaker If a service is down, we want to avoid continuously making calls to the service, till it gets time to recover. If the number of request failures are above a threshold then we decide to return a default response. After a certain period we will allow few requests to hit the service and if the response is good, we will allow all the traffic.\nStates\nOpen - No traffic is sent. Closed - All traffic is sent. Half-Open - After timeout only few calls are allowed. https://youtu.be/ADHcBxEXvFA\n45. Consistent Hashing Nodes keep dying in a distributed system. To scale new nodes can be added as well. Consistent hashing lets you distribute traffic among the nodes uniformly.\nWhy not use round-robin to distribute traffic? Services often cache some data or store local data, so it makes for a better design if the same client request is sent to the server which has all the data already cached/locally stored. If you send the same client request randomly to random servers each time then cache/local data is not utilized.\nConsistent hashing also prevents DOS attacks to some extent. If a spam client send random requests and round robin distributes it across all nodes then the outage is large scale. However with consitent hashing only certain node will be impacted.\nIf you just hash the request and map it to a server then if the node count changes all the requests will be impacted and will move to different servers. Hence in consistent hashing we hash both the request and the servers to a hash space and link them in a hash ring. With consistent hashing adding a new servers affects only few requests.\nThe distribution of servers in a hash ring may not be uniform hence you can use virtual servers. With more virtual servers the distribution is more balanced. Eg: if there are 60K user requests and there are 6 servers each server can distribute and handle 10K. Do note that if one node goes down then all the requests flood the next node causing it to go down thus causing a full outage. Virtual servers will avoid this to some extent.\nhttps://youtu.be/UF9Iqmg94tk\n46. Rate limit Token Bucket - Burst - Fixed token are added to bucket, bucket is always kept in full state. Can lead to burst of traffic. Token Bucket - Sustain - Constant token are added to bucket only if previous token are consumed. Smooth traffic. Leaky Bucket - Bucket size if fixed, if bucket full request are rejected, a processor de-queue bucket at fixed rate. Fixed Window - For the time period maintain a key,value pair (key=time, value=counter). If counter is greater than rate limit reject. Leads to burst traffic around edges of time period. eg: If rate limit is 10 per min, then 8 request come in the last 30 sec of min window and 8 more requests come in the first 30 second of next min window, within the window the rate limit is honored but we still processed 16 requests within a 1 min window. Sliding Log - Go over all previous nodes upto the time interval, in the link list and check rate limit exceeded, if yes then reject. Since the 1 min window keeps changing traffic is smooth unlike fixed window. Sliding Window Counter - Go over all previous nodes upto the time interval, in the link list and check if rate limit exceeded, if yes then reject. Instead of storing each request timestamp like sliding log, previous node stores the count. Places where rate limit can be applied\nhttps://youtu.be/9CIjoWPwAhU\nhttps://youtu.be/FU4WlwfS3G0\n47. Push vs Pull strategy RabbitMQ is push based, Kafka is pull based Push is expensive \u0026amp; real-time Pull is cheap but not real-time 48. NIO Majority of threads spend time waiting, NIO (non-blocking IO) take the approach of not blocking the threads. Eg: Spring Reactor\nNon-Blocking IO helps systems scale with fewer resources. The complete source to destination flow has to be non-blocking. 49. Multi-Tenancy Multiple customers share same resource/server but customers are not aware of each other and instances are isolated. eg: Kubernetes namespaces\n50. Authorization vs Authentication Authentication - Is the user allowed to use the system? Authorization - Does the user have the right role/permission to execute that operation? 51. Service Mesh \u0026amp; API Gateway API gateway is a component sits between clients and services and provides centralized handling of API communication between them. API Gateway authenticates all traffic before routing it to the called service\nService-to-service communication is essential in a distributed application but routing this communication, both within and across application clusters, becomes increasingly complex as the number of services grows. Service mesh enables managed, observable, and secure communication between individual services. It works with a service discovery protocol to detect services. Istio and envoy are some of the most commonly used service mesh frameworks.\nuser-to-service connectivity is called north-south connectivity, API gateway controls this communication. service-to-service connectivity is called east-west connectivity, service mesh controls this communication. Functions of API gateway\nService Discovery Load Balancing Circuit Breaker Distributed Tracing \u0026amp; Logging Telemetry Security - Authentication \u0026amp; Authorization Routing - Routing, circuit breaker, blue-green and canary deployments, load balancing, health checks, and custom error handling Observability Rate limiting Caching Request and Response Transformation API gateways can be augmented with web application firewall (WAF) and denial of service (DoS) protection. Depending on the system architecture and app delivery requirements, an API gateway can be deployed in front of the Kubernetes cluster as a load balancer (multi-cluster level), at its edge as an Ingress controller (cluster-level), or within it as a service mesh (service-level).\n52. Deployment Strategy Guidelines for deployment\nEnsure that database schema works with both new version and old version of the service. Provide health check url to determine if node is healthy. Ensure rollback works. Types of deployment\nRolling - Services are upgraded one after the other. Blue Green - Few services are upgraded and test teams validate and signoff before all services are upgraded. Canary - Few services are upgraded and part of the traffic hits these new instances. 53. GeoHashing \u0026amp; Quadtree GeoHashing\nGeohashing is a geocoding method used to encode geographic coordinates such as latitude and longitude into short alphanumeric strings. Coordinates lat 40.730610, long -73.935242. can be represented in geohash as af3bdmcef. By comparing strings we can tell if the 2 locations are closer to each other, depending on how many chars in string match.\neg: Geohashes af3bdmcef and af3bdmcfg are spatially closer as they share the prefix af3bdm.\nEasier to store in DB. Easier to share in URL. Easier to find nearest neighbour based on string match. QuadTree\nA quadtree is an in-memory tree data structure that is commonly used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants (grids) until the contents of the grids meet certain criteria. Internal node has exactly four children, only the leaf nodes store the actual value. Quadtrees enable us to search points within a two-dimensional range.\nEg: Identify all restaurants/cabs in the 1.5 miles/km range from given point. If there are no restaurants/cabs in the grid/node then add neighbouring grids/nodes.\n54. Optimistic vs Pessimistic Locking Locking is required to prevent the row from being updated by 2 threads concurrently there by corrupting the data.\nPessimistic Locking - The lock is now applied by the database at row level or table level. If the lock is a WRITE lock it prevents other threads from modifying the data. eg: SELECT * from TABLE where id = 1 for update; Optimistic Locking - A version field is introduced to the database table, The JPA ensures that version check is done before saving data, if the version has changed the update will throw Error. Scalability is high with this approach. https://gitorko.github.io/post/optimistic-pessimistic-locking/\n55. Event sourcing Instead of storing the update to an object/record, change the db to append only. Every change to the object/record is stored as a new entry in append fashion.\nEg: A customer record, each time address of customer changes instead of updating existing column, just insert new row with the new address. A materialized view can be generated from this data to get the latest customer record. Combining all the records gives latest customer record.\nUpdates can come from multiple sources, there is no contention to update. Consistency for transactional data based on the time the event was processed. Maintain full audit trails and history. Slower to generate the materialized view. 56. Attack surfaces To avoid security breaches, the objective of all systems must be to reduce the number of attack surfaces. More the components in your system, more the attack surfaces that need to be hardened.\nSecurity Hardening\nNetwork packet spoofing / eavesdropping - Someone on the same network can look at http packets using tools like wireshark, http packets are un-encrypted. Use https to prevent this attack Man-in-the-middle attack - Someone pretending to be the actual client, Use SSL authentication with symmetric encryption. Denial-Of-Service - Someone can overload your server and keep it busy so valid requests won't be processed. use rate limiting, IP blacklisting. Bot attack - Millions of bots can be made to looks like real traffic is hitting your service. Use re-captcha to identify real users. Storing CVV, passwords in DB - Avoid storing plain text passwords in DB. Always use salt (piece of random data added to a password before it is hashed and stored) Reading Passwords - Avoid assigning passwords to Strings, instead assign them to char array. String use string pool in java so the password are not garbage collected immediately and may show up in heap dumps. Firewall \u0026amp; ports - Enable firewall and open only the ports that are required. eg: close ftp port is not needed. Token expiry - Always set short expiry (TTL) for tokens, if compromised then the token will expire soon. Roles - Always provide only needed roles to users, so that even if password is compromised permissions restrict them from doing more damage. DMZ - Demilitarized zone, restrict backend servers from having direct access to internet. If backend servers need internet configure a forward proxy. SSH Tunneling - SSH to a primary server and then open a tunnel to the actual server. Auditing - Always ensure proper auditing and logging is available to trace any breaches. Backup \u0026amp; Checkpoint - Always ensure proper backups are available in case data needs reconciliation. Checkpoint run at short interval capturing the snapshot of the current system. 57. Kubernetes Kubernetes is a platform for managing containerized workloads.\nService discovery Load balancing Storage orchestration Automated rollout \u0026amp; rollback Resource usage enforcement Self-healing Secret \u0026amp; Configuration management https://gitorko.github.io/post/kubernetes-basics/\n58. Indexing - Btree, B+tree, BitMap Indexes help find the required data in large data set. Full table scan are costly hence reducing the search space is always preferred.\nBitMap index - A binary array to represent value, Uses less memory. Btree - Creates a balanced tree on insert. B+tree - Similar to btree but values are present only in the node. Improves range queries. Btree (Max Degree 3)\nB+tree (Max Degree 3)\nhttps://youtu.be/UzHl2VzyZS4 https://youtu.be/5-JYVeM3IQg\nhttps://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BTree.html https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html\n59. Data Race \u0026amp; Race conditions Data Race - Multiple threads access shared variable at same time without synchronization \u0026amp; at least one thread is writing, can cause corruption. Eg: Addition to long/double which are 64 bits.\nRace conditions - Multiple threads access shared variable, value of variable depends on execution order of threads. Atomic looking operations are not done atomically.\nRace conditions can be of 2 types\nCheck \u0026amp; Update - When two threads check if value present in map and put if absent.To prevent use locks or putIfAbsent atomic operations. Read \u0026amp; Update - When two threads read a value and increment it. Use locks or atomic variables. https://youtu.be/KGnXr62bgHM\n60. Merkel Tree Merkle tree also known as hash tree is a data structure used for data verification and synchronization. It's a tree data structure where each non-leaf node is a hash of its child nodes.\nIf the file is 100 GB then its chunked into 4 parts, A hash is calculated for each chunk and the merkle tree created. If any chunk of the file is corrupted then it's easy to detect it and fix it by comparing new merkle tree to the original merkle tree as the hash on corrupted side doesn't match.\nThis structure of the tree allows efficient mapping of huge data and small changes made to the data can be easily identified. If we want to know where data change has occurred then we will not have to traverse the whole structure but only a small part of the structure. The root hash is used as the fingerprint for the entire data. If root hash doesn't match then some data below has changed. 61. Pub-Sub vs Point-To-Point Message brokers allows systems to communicate with each other asynchronously. This ensures loose coupling between systems. Different messaging protocols AMQP, STOMP, MQTT can be used.\nPoint-to-Point messaging: Message sent to queue is sent to only one consumer. Publish-subscribe messaging: Message sent to the topic is sent to all subscribers. Guarantee that every message will only be delivered once.\n62. Availability Metrics Availability is the percentage of time that a system is operational (uptime). Measured in number of 9s. A service with 99.99% availability is described as having four 9s.\nAvailability (Percent) Downtime (Year) Downtime (Month) Downtime (Day) 99.9% (three nine) 8h 45m 43m 49s 1m 26s 99.99% (four nine) 52m 35s 4m 22s 8s https://uptime.is/\nSequence vs Parallel Availability\n63. Testing Functional testing\nUnit tests - Developers write tests that test only the specific function, interaction with DB or other services are mocked. Integration tests - Writing tests that interact with other components like DB or external services, validates system interactions. Functional tests - Similar to integration testing, but validates functionality, real use cases. Regression tests - Run by QE team, automation scripts that executes tests and validate against recurrence of known issues. User Acceptance tests (UAT) - Testing done by user/customer before accepting the system. Smoke test / Sanity test - Testing done in production after deployment. Non-Functional Testing\nPerformance \u0026amp; Scale test - Testing done by perf team to identify performance and scale issues. Security test - Testing done to ensure no security vulnerabilities exist. Usability test - Tests if the colors and button placement are good. Tracks user behaviour when using the system. Soak test - Runs suite of tests that run for longer period of time. eg: 2 days, 1 week etc. 64. REST POST is always for creating a resource (does not matter if it was duplicated) PUT is for checking if resource exists then update, else create new resource. PATCH is always for updating a resource. PUT is idempotent method means that the result of a successful performed request is independent of the number of times it is executed.\nMethod Description Idempotent GET Get a resource object Yes PUT Create a resource object or replace it Yes DELETE Delete a resource object Yes POST Create a new resource object No HEAD Return meta data of resource object Yes PATCH Apply partial update on resource object False OPTIONS Determine what HTTP methods are supported by a particular resource Yes 65. Types of database Relational Database - Each row is a record and column is a field in the record. eg: PostgresSQL, MySQL Columnar Database - Stores data by columns, handle write-heavy workloads. Eg: Apache Cassandra, HBase Document Database - Data is semi-structured, encoded in json, xml, bson eg: MongoDB, Couchbase Graph Database - Entities are represented as nodes and relations as edges, easier to perform complex relationship-based queries. eg: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune Key-Value Database - Data is stored in key value pairs, can be easily partitioned and scaled horizontally. eg: Redis, Amazon DynamoDB Time-Series Database - Optimized for timestamp data, comes with time based functions. eg: TimescaleDB 66. Domain Name System (DNS) Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-friendly domain names into their corresponding IP addresses\nLookup starts with the root server that points to the right TLD. Top-Level Domain (TLD) server points to the authoritative name server. Eg: TLD .com belongs to verisign The authoritative name server points to the zone or zone file that holds the DNS record. 67. Distributed File Systems Distributed file systems are storage solutions designed to manage and provide access to files and directories across multiple servers, nodes, or machines, often distributed over a network. eg: HDFS\n68. Full-text Search (Inverted Index) Full-text search enables users to search for specific words or phrases. Full-text search relies on an inverted index, which is a data structure that maps words or phrases to the documents in which they appear. An inverted index is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words/numbers, to its locations in a document or a set of documents eg: Elasticsearch\nTwo types of inverted indexes\nRecord-Level: Contains a list of references to documents for each word. Word-Level: Contains the positions of each word within a document. 69. Backend for FrontEnd pattern (BFF) BFF is a variant of the API Gateway pattern, Instead of a single point of entry, it introduces multiple gateways. You can have a tailored API that targets the needs of each client (mobile, web, desktop, voice assistant, etc.) Decoupling of Backend and Frontend gives us faster time to market as frontend teams can have dedicated backend teams serving their unique needs. The release of new features of one frontend does not affect the other.\nOther Topics Normalization vs De-Normalization Federation First Level vs Second Level Cache Distributed tracing - Zipkin Observability - wavefront, prometheus, nagios Hadoop - Map Reduce CAS - compare and swap Client side load balancing GitOps \u0026amp; CI/CD Telemetry Block chain - distributed ledger Concurrent HashMap Internals (HashMap vs syncronizedMap vs ConcurrentHashMap) Disaster recovery Auto scaling Batch vs Stream data processing vs Micro Batch Star vs Snow flake schema Time Series Database Hyperlog Elasticsearch OAuth 2.0 Java Fibers - Project Loom RPC, gRPC Rest vs SOAP vs GraphQL Scatter Gather Pattern CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) P2P Network Tor network \u0026amp; VPN SOLID Design principles SSL vs TLS vs mTLS Storage types Hierarchy timing wheel RSync LSM tree Salt / Ansible JIT (Just in Time) compiler Operational transformation - Shared document edit Strangler pattern API versioning Backend for frontend (BFF) pattern Transaction propagation \u0026amp; rollback policy Adaptive Bitrate Streaming for video Scenarios Each of the usecases below highlights a good system design practice:\nAvoid making backend calls if possible. Avoid using contention for shared resources. Avoid updating row, consider inserts over updates. If possible create objects of representative resources instead of using counter Split the big task to smaller task, consider failure and retry Use a queue in cases where producer can produce more than consumer can consume Minimize the request-response time window. 1. Design a shopping cart application. Users should be able to browse the various products and add them to cart and buy them.\nIf the products are rendered on a web page for each request, then the system won't scale. Browsing products is more frequent than buying something. Generate a static website and upload to CDN, only the buy rest api calls hit the backend server. Home pages or landing pages which are frequently hit perform better if they are static sites and on the CDN. Even for user tailored home pages like Netflix, Hotstar etc, generate static sites per user and avoid actual backend calls as much as possible. Each service in a micro-service architecture needs to have its own database. The external payment gateway can fail to respond hence there must be job to periodically check if the payment failed and no response came. Once the order is placed the customer is redirected to the external payment gateway url with a callback url the gateway will call on success of payment. Tip If you can design a system where the calls never have to hit your backend service it improves the design. Eg: CDN, Edge Server, Cache etc. Look at client side caching as well if it means avoiding that backend call.\n2. Design a URL shortener service (Tiny URL) Users will provide a long url, your service needs to return a short url. If the users lookup the short url service needs to return the actual url.\nIf you generate a short url with UUID there can be collision if the key is same. More collisions more time is spent in returning a response degrading your service. The system will not scale. If the pre-created hash/short url code are stored in a RDBMS database there is contention at the db when all the threads ask for the next free key. Ensure that pre-created short url code are not sequential so that someone should not guess what the next key can be simply by incrementing one character. The ratio of read to write (READ:WRITE) are not same. For every 1 write the reads can be 1000. 1:1000. Someone creates a tiny url and shares it with is 1000 followers. There will be more reads compared to writes. Since we have more reads than writes we will use CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern here. The Generate key service will populate the queue with the short-url codes. Generate key service will ensure that duplicate keys are not loaded by generating short urls in range eg: A-F, G-N ranges. A consistent hashing service will handle the situation where we add more queues to the group or cases when queues die. The put operation first fetches a key from the queue, since there are multiple queues there is no contention to get a new key. It then writes the key \u0026amp; value to the database. If we need to scaling even more, we can use region specific sharding. The service will then need to be aware of the shards to write to and read from. eg: Asia vs North America shard. Nodes go down often, so if the queues die then there can be unused keys that are forever lost. We use a recovery task that runs nightly to recover any lost keys. Few other design approach suggest zookeeper to maintain range of keys, In the above design the service doesn't need to be aware of ranges hence we dont need Zookeeper or consensus manager. If the short url has to be generated on fly then you can use DB to know the ranges each node is handling, overhead of zookeeper doesn't justify the benefits. A tiny url fetches will have more probability of being queried again in short span hence cache will avoid the database call. Note Be aware of collisions in hashing (when hash is same), on a new environment there will be fewer collisions but as your data grows collisions will increase.\nTip Avoid contention for resources, contentions grow exponentially as system scales. The simple act of asking the DB for the next free record among a set, incrementing a particular row value are examples where contention can occur.\n3. Design a Youtube / Facebook like counter service Users can like a post/video and submit their likes, the service needs to count how many likes a post/video has.\nA single counter that needs to be updated by many threads always creates contention. Addition operation needs to be atomic making it difficult to scale. If you treat the counter as a row in the DB and use optimistic locking with retry logic to increment with exponential backoff you avoid locking the resource but there are multiple attempts to update the counter which causes scale issues. So relational database is out of picture. You can read more about 'Dynamic Striping' \u0026amp; Long Adder \u0026amp; Long Accumulator to get an idea how java does addition operation on scale. However this is restricted to a single instance. If you consider each like counter as a new row you avoid contention of an update but more time is spent in summing up the total by counting all rows. If the counter can be approx values, then you can use Count-Min Sketch approach. Redis provides atomic operations of increment. We dont want to keep a single video like counter on one node as it can overload it if there are more likes for that video compared to others. By using Round Robin we can scale our service by adding more redis nodes. We use a Queue event model to let the count aggregator service to sum the counts across all redis nodes and save that to a DB. The get count will always read the DB for latest count. There will be a slight delay from the time we submit the like till we see the count which is eventual consistency. The event queue payload can carry information about nodes that got updated, this way the aggregator service need not iterate over all redis nodes. Tip Avoid updating DB rows in most cases, updates don't scale. Always prefer using inserts/append over updates.\nTip To prevent race conditions optimistic or pessimistic locking need to be used and they dont scale. Use redis for atomic increment \u0026amp; decrement as they guarantee atomicity.\n4. Design an Advertisement Impression Service tied to a budget For a give budget, ads of a particular type are served. Once the budget is exhausted the ads should not be served. For the type shoes, Nike has a budget of 1000$ and Adidas has a budget of 500$. When a website wants to display an ad it calls your service which randomly returns an ad, ensuring that the budget is not exceeded. If each ad impression costs 1$ then you can do 1000 Ad impressions of Nike and 500 impression of Adidas.\nIt looks similar to the like counter service, where we can (atomic) decrement the budget based on the number of Ads being served. An incoming request randomly picks an Ad and decrements the budget for that Ad till it reaches 0. However such a design will still run into contention when scaled because of the decrement operation. The contention occurs when we want to decrement the budget, since we cant distribute the budget value across multiple nodes, the decrement operation still needs to happen on one node and in atomic fashion. Assume there is only 1 Nike brand with a budget of 1M. Now when there is huge load since there is only 1 brand and the budget needs to be decremented as an atomic operation, even though redis can do atomic decrement operations, it will still slow down the system since all the threads are waiting to decrement the single budget entity. A token seeder pre-populates dedicated queues with a single token. Based on the budget, an equal number of tokens are populated. Nike Queue will have 1000 token, Adidas Queue will have 500 tokens. When the request comes in for a shoe type Ad. A random queue is picked and a token dequeued. Based on that token the associated ad is served. Once the Queue is out of tokens no Ads are served for that brand. The Ad fetcher service needs to be aware of which queue to deque, it needs to be aware of how many queues are associated with the given brand. If a queue goes down the token seeder can identify and recreate a new queue based on the transactional log that is held by each service to identify how many tokens were already served. If there is a new brand that wants to join, just create the tokens and seed a queue and add it to the group. The next round-robin should pick it up. Tip Instead of incrementing/decrementing a counter, check if it's possible to create tokens ahead of time. With a bunch of tokens in a queue/bucket it's easier to scale than trying to update a single counter in atomic fashion.\n4. Design a Code Build \u0026amp; Deploy System Build the code when someone commits code to a branch and deploy it to a machine.\nBuilds can take long time to complete hence split the task into 2, if deploy fails we don't want to build again. Writing the records to DB would take more time compared to pushing to queue and polling the DB would need retry mechanism without wasting cpu cycles, hence using RabbitMQ is a better fit. Builds can take time, so we dont want the manager service constantly polling workers. Once the worker completes it will push an event that will be consumed by manager service to continue the deployment flow. If workers die during the build then heartbeat will not be updated and a scheduler can restart the job. If the build nodes make a direct connection for heart beat this can overwhelm the manager service as there will be many worker nodes. We maintain dedicated queues for each region. If one region is under heavy load we can add more consumers/workers to address that region. A periodic job checks for worker node heartbeat, if the TTL has expired then will restart the job. After the build is done the queue is updated, the next stage of deploy is started. Tip Split the tasks into smaller sub-tasks so that they can be restarted in case of failure.\n5. Design a large scale file de-duplication service You will receive a number of files (customer records) in a folder once a day, the file sizes range from 10GB-50GB that need to be de-duplicated based on few columns eg: Name \u0026amp; phone number column.\nProcessing a large file takes time. So chunking the file into manageable sizes helps distribute the task, and restart if some tasks fail. Avoid in-memory processing like Sets/Maps which can easily run out of memory. You can use a database with unique constraints, but this is write intensive task hence won't scale. Since the files arrive once a day, this is more batch oriented and not streaming task. Use a Bloom Filter a probabilistic data structure. This is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. There can be False-positive matches but no false negatives. Pick a big bit array \u0026amp; many hash functions to avoid collision this will avoid false positives as much as possible. Bloom filter bit array resides in memory hence ensure that the file is processed by the same service. If the bit array needs to be shared, use redis in-memory BITFIELD If false positive can not be avoided despite the large hash range, we can rely upon db unique constraints check as the 2nd level check to verify only records that are identified as duplicate. Tip Smaller tasks take less time, can be restarted/retried, can be distributed. Always check if the input data can be chunked \u0026amp; tasks made to smaller units instead of one big task.\nTip When there are more producers than consumers it will quickly overwhelm the system, use a queue to store and process the tasks asynchronously.\n6. Design a flash sale system You have limited items that are up for sale. You can expect a large number of users trying to buy the product by adding it to the shopping cart. You cant oversell or undersell.\nThe main objective is to keep the request-response window small. If the request waits (synchronous) till the operation of adding to cart is complete it will bring down the system. We will use a rabbitmq to queue the incoming burst of requests, hot-potato handling. As soon as the request to add to cart is received we will add it to the queue. Each user after placing the request to add to cart will be in wait state and query the status of his request. If the add to cart operation has to be completed within same request-response then use the same design as used in use case 4 Design an Advertisement Impression Service tied to a budget where you pre-allocate token on the queue.\nReal Implementation\nhttps://gitorko.github.io/flash-sale-system/\nTip Always minimize the request-response time window. The longer the request is kept open it will negatively impact the system.\n7. Design a chat server The chat server needs to support 1-1 and group text based chat. The client can be offline and will receive all the message when they are back online.\nPublish-Subscribe pattern, asynchronous in nature. We need to store the data to be read later when consumer is offline, hence Kafka seems a good fit, however Kafka topic and partition management introduces latency hence we use redis queue instead. We will split the command channel and data channel. Command channel only send the next call-back url and action to invoke. The client will fetch the data via HTTP call. Data traffic is heavy and hence will not overload the command bidirectional channel. We will partition the users based on region. Which region maps to which active service is maintained by config database. Each user will have a dedicated queue to which messages will written. The same messages will be written to the DB as well in append only mode. This can be done either by service writing to both or from queue-queue transfer (i.e persist-queue transfer to delivery-queue). In case the queue failure/user migration the message in DB which are not acknowledged will be reloaded to the queue. If the communication is uni-directional we can use SSE, since we want to send heartbeats we will use websocket which is bidirectional. The metadata can be stored in Relation database, which the message itself can be stored in Document Database.

Team fit - Will hiring the candidate create conflict within teams? Role fit - Will candidate meet the role requirements? Questions\nWhy are you leaving your organization? What was the toughest problem you solved? How do you deal with an ill-tempered colleague? What do you do when your proposed design is shot-down by other peers? What do you do when a junior causes a production outage? Questions you can ask\nHow is the work culture? How often is the on-call \u0026amp; release cycles? What is the career growth path/levels at the org? Are the projects greenfield (new) or brownfield (existing)? How big are the teams and how many levels are there in the reporting structure? What is the cash:stock options in salary component? Tips\nAvoid blaming others. Take ownership for success \u0026amp; failure. Learn to delegate responsibilities \u0026amp; trust people to complete it. Accept feedback both positive \u0026amp; negative. Use the organization tools \u0026amp; procedures to handle conflicts that are beyond your control. Seek Peer or Mentor review/feedback when in doubt. Team accomplishment prioritizes over individual accomplishment. Treat others how you would like to be treated.

What do you do?\nYour server is receiving a lot of bad TCP connections. To test this make the thread count to 1 and change the connection timeout to 10 ms. Now issue a telnet command to connect to the running port, It will connect but since no data is sent the TCP connection is closed in 10 ms. Introduce a bigger timeout and try to hit the rest api when telnet is blocking the single connection, your rest api will wait till the TCP connection is free.\n1server.tomcat.threads.max=1 2server.tomcat.connection-timeout=10 3 4telnet localhost 31000 The connection timeout means - If the client is not sending data after establishing the TCP handshake for 'N' seconds then close the connection.\n1server.tomcat.connection-timeout=5000 Note Most will assume that this connection timeout actually closes the connection when a long running task takes more than 'N' seconds. This is not true. It only closes connection if the client doesnt send anything for 'N' seconds.\nTimeLimiter Problem A new team member has updated a function and introduced a bug and the function is very slow or never returns a response. What do you do?\nIf a function takes too long to complete it will block the tomcat thread which will further degrade the system performance. Use Resilience4j to explicitly timeout long running jobs, this way runaway functions cant impact your entire system.\n1@TimeLimiter(name = \u0026#34;service1-tl\u0026#34;) Spring also provides spring.mvc.async.request-timeout that you can explore to accomplish the same.\nNote Always assume the functions within your service will take forever and may never complete, design accordingly.\nRequest Thread Pool \u0026amp; Connections Problem Users are reporting slow connection / timeout when connecting to your server? How many concurrent requests can your server handle?\nThere 2 types of protocol a tomcat server can be configured for\nBIO - Blocking IO, In the case of BIO the threads are not free till the response is sent back. NIO - Non-Blocking IO, In the case of NIO the threads are free to serve other requests the incoming request is waiting for IO to complete. The number of threads determine how many thread can handle the incoming requests. This means default of 200 threads are ready to serve the requests\n1# Applies for NIO \u0026amp; BIO 2server.tomcat.threads.max=200 Max number of connections the server can accept and process, for BIO (Blocking IO) tomcat the server.tomcat.threads.max = server.tomcat.max-connections You cant have more connections than the threads.\nFor NIO tomcat, the number of threads can be less and the max-connections can be more. Since the threads not blocked while waiting for IO to complete then can open up more connections and server other requests.\n1# Applies only for NIO 2server.tomcat.max-connections: 500 Note The number of tomcat threads and the server hardware determine how many requests can be served in a given time interval. If you have 200 threads (BIO) and all request response on average take 1 second to complete then your server can handle 200 requests per second.\nKeep-Alive Problem Network admin calls you to tell that many TCP connections are being created to the same clients. What do you do?\nTCP connections take time to be established, keep-alive keeps the connection alive for some more time incase the client want to send more data again in the new future.\nmax-keep-alive-requests - Max number of HTTP requests that can be pipelined before connection is closed. keep-alive-timeout - Keeps the TCP connection for sometime to avoid doing a handshake again if request from same client is sent.\n1server.tomcat.max-keep-alive-requests = 100 2server.tomcat.keep-alive-timeout = 10 Rest Client Connection Timeout Problem You are invoking rest calls to an external service which has degraded and has become very slow there by causing your service to slow down. What do you do?\nIf the server makes external calls ensure to set the read and connection timeout on the restTemplate. If you dont set this then your server which is a client will wait forever to get the response.\n1# If unable to connect the external server then give up after 5 seconds. 2setConnectTimeout(5_000); 3 4# If unable to read data from external api call then give up after 5 seconds. 5setReadTimeout(5_000); Note Always assume that all external API calls never return and design accordingly.\nDatabase Connection Pool Problem Users are reporting slowness in api that fetch relatively small data. What do you do?\nSpring boot provides Hikari connection pool by default. If there are run away SQL connections then service can quickly run out of connection in the pool and slow down the entire system.\nTo test this we restrict the pool size to 1 to make the error simulation easy.\n1spring.hikari.maximumPoolSize: 1 By setting the connectionTimeout we ensure that when the connection pool is full then we timeout after 1 second instead of waiting forever to get a new connection.\n1spring.hikari.connectionTimeout=1000 Now when you trigger the api, You will see an error, only the first query succeeds and rest will fail. Fail-Fast is always preferred than slowing down the entire service.\n1Caused by: java.sql.SQLTransientConnectionException: HikariPool-1 - Connection is not available, request timed out after 253ms. Note Always assume that you will run out of database connections due to a run away or storm of requests and design accordingly.\nSlow Query Problem Users are reporting slowness in a db fetch api that fetches data from multiple tables via join. Your DBA also confirms that query is too slow. What do you do?\nSlow queries often slow down the entire system. To test this we explicitly slow down a query with pg_sleep function.\nWe set timeout on the transaction to ensure that slow query doesn't impact the entire system, after 5 seconds if the query doesnt return result an exception is thrown.\n1@Transactional(timeout = 5) Note Always assume that all DB calls never return or are very slow and design accordingly.\nYou can further look at optimizing the query with help of indexes however here we design the backend system such that the service doesnt fail as a whole due to slow queries.\nMemory Leak \u0026amp; CPU Spike Problem You have developed your service on your laptop, you tested with a big heap memory setting. However your kubernetes admin calls you to inform that kubernetes is a shared resource and you can't consume so much memory. What do you do?\nMemory leaks are always hard to debug, a badly written method can cause spike in memory usage causing other services to struggle with heap memory and in turn causing lot of GC (garbage collection) which are stop of the world events.\nWith kubernetes you can define resource limits that kill the pod if tries to use more resources than allocated.\n1resources: 2 requests: 3 cpu: \u0026#34;250m\u0026#34; 4 memory: \u0026#34;250Mi\u0026#34; 5 limits: 6 cpu: \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; 7 memory: \u0026#34;380Mi\u0026#34; Now when you invoke the api that causes a memory spike, the pod will be killed (OOMKilled) and a new pod brought up.\nNote An OutOfMemoryError side the pod doesnt necessarily kill the pod unless some health check is configured. Pod will still remain in running state despite the OOM error. Only the resource limits defined determine when the pod gets killed.\n1Exception in thread \u0026#34;http-nio-31000-exec-1\u0026#34; java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space Response Payload Size Problem Your rest api returns list of customer records, However as more customers are added in production the size of response becomes bigger \u0026amp; bigger and slows down the request-response times.\nAlways add pagination support and avoid returning all the data in a single response. Data may grow later causing response size to get bigger over a period of time.\nEnable gzip compression which also reduce the size of response payload.\n1server.compression.enabled=true 2 3# Minimum response when compression will kick in 4server.compression.min-response-size=512 5 6# Mime types that should be compressed 7server.compression.mime-types=text/xml, text/plain, application/json You can also change the protocol to http2 to get more benefits like multiplexing many requests over single tcp connection.\n1server.http2.enabled=true Note Always try to reduce the size of the response payload. Use pagination for data records and gzip payload to reduce the size.\nAPI versioning Problem A new team member has updated an existing API \u0026amp; introduced a new feature that was used by many downstream applications, however a bug got introduced and now all the downstream api are failing.\nAlways look at versioning your api instead of updating existing api that are used by downstream services. This contains the blast radius of any bug.\neg: /api/v1/customers being the old api and /api/v2/customers being the new api\nNote Backward compatibility is very important, specially when services rollback to older versions in distributed systems. Always work with versioned API if there are major changes or new features being introduced.\nOther Failures Once you expand the distributed system there can be various other points of failure\nPrimary DB failure Secondary DB replication failure Queue failures Network failures External System can go down Service nodes can go down Cache invalidation/eviction failure Load Balancer failures Datacenter failure for one region Code 1package com.demo.project57;

Priority must be given to clear order placed first. FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Order buy/sell will be whole quantity. Order can be split but buy/sell has to be complete. Can't have partial buy/sell in a single order. Case 1 : Order match in sequential time order (FIFO) Event Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 100 COMPLETED 10:01 AM SELL 10.0 200 COMPLETED 10:02 AM SELL 10.0 300 SUBMIT 10:03 AM BUY 10.0 300 COMPLETED Case 2 : Order match in sequential time order but preference to order fulfillment Event Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 100 COMPLETED 10:01 AM SELL 10.0 200 10:02 AM SELL 10.0 300 COMPLETED SUBMIT 10:03 AM BUY 10.0 400 COMPLETED Case 3 : First sell order too small, will never fulfill blocking others, so will be skipped Event Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 100 10:01 AM SELL 10.0 200 COMPLETED 10:02 AM SELL 10.0 300 COMPLETED SUBMIT 10:03 AM BUY 10.0 500 Case 4 : First sell order too big, will never fulfill blocking others, so will be skipped Event Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 1000 10:01 AM SELL 10.0 200 COMPLETED 10:02 AM SELL 10.0 300 COMPLETED SUBMIT 10:03 AM BUY 10.0 500 COMPLETED Case 5 : Middle sell order too big, will never fulfill blocking others, so will be skipped Event Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 100 COMPLETED 10:01 AM SELL 10.0 2000 10:02 AM SELL 10.0 300 COMPLETED SUBMIT 10:03 AM BUY 10.0 400 COMPLETED Case 6 : Order match when price is different One seller wanted to sell at 9$ but we can fulfill order at 10$ as there is a buyer. So all sellers gets 10$ It's ok for seller to get above asking price but not go below the asking price.\nEvent Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 100 COMPLETED 10:01 AM SELL 10.0 200 10:02 AM SELL 9.0 300 COMPLETED SUBMIT 10:03 AM BUY 10.0 400 COMPLETED Case 7 : Order match when price is different Two sellers wanted to sell at 9$ \u0026amp; 8$ but we can fulfill order at 10$ as there is a buyer. So all sellers gets 10$ It's ok for seller to get above asking price but not go below the asking price.\nEvent Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 100 COMPLETED 10:01 AM SELL 9.0 200 10:02 AM SELL 8.0 300 COMPLETED SUBMIT 10:03 AM BUY 10.0 400 COMPLETED Case 8 : Order match when price is different There is a cheaper sell order of 8$ however due to time preference (FIFO) we complete the order with the 10$ \u0026amp; 9$\nEvent Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 100 COMPLETED 10:01 AM SELL 9.0 200 COMPLETED 10:02 AM SELL 8.0 300 SUBMIT 10:03 AM BUY 10.0 300 COMPLETED Case 9 : Order can't be fulfilled Event Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 100 10:01 AM SELL 10.0 200 10:02 AM SELL 10.0 300 SUBMIT 10:03 AM BUY 10.0 50 Case 10 : Sell orders at the same time \u0026amp; same price Event Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 200 COMPLETED 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 100 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 200 COMPLETED SUBMIT 10:01 AM BUY 10.0 400 COMPLETED Case 11 : Sell orders at the same time \u0026amp; different price Event Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 200 COMPLETED 10:00 AM SELL 9.0 100 10:00 AM SELL 8.0 200 COMPLETED SUBMIT 10:01 AM BUY 10.0 400 COMPLETED Cases for Buy order is similar/inverse of the above cases.\nCase 12 : No fractional order fulfillment Event Time Type Price Qty Status 10:00 AM SELL 10.0 200 SUBMIT 10:00 AM BUY 10.0 100 If fractional order could be fulfilled then you could look at implementing the algorithm with a Priority Queue (Min Heap \u0026amp; Max Heap). Where heap is sorted by price and then by time. In such a case the algorithm becomes simple and just insertion and deletion to heap can be done in constant time. If heaps are implemented then in the above case, if there are only 2 transactions in the entire day. Then the seller will only be able to sell 100 items out of 200. Since there cant be fractional buy/sell we will not use Priority Queue (Heaps).\nNon-Functional Requirements Latency should be low. System should be highly available \u0026amp; survive restarts System should scale well when number of orders increases. Should be able to distribute the service with sticky affinity for one type of ticker. Design Real world trading algorithms are more complex, involve more memory \u0026amp; cpu optimized data structures, and can handle huge volumes. Most trading systems are written in C/C++.\nThe order matching algorithm uses backtracking which is limited by the recursive stack depth. If the CombinationSum backtracking job can be further split and scheduled across different worker nodes the throughput will increase further.\nIt uses single thread per ticker and is limited by the thread pool size to support more tickers. No synchronization is required as its a single thread model per ticker\nSystem is able to match \u0026amp; process 5,000 unique orders per ticker in 2 mins that roughly 40+ matching transactions per second per ticker on a Mac Laptop\nCode 1package com.demo.project100.service;

It supports cache in memory and disk, It supports eviction policies such as LRU, LFU, FIFO. Ehcache uses Last Recently Used (LRU) eviction strategy for memory \u0026amp; Last Frequently Used (LFU) as the eviction strategy for disk store.\nEhcache Caching Tiers - Caching layer can consist of more than one memory area. When using more than one memory area, the areas are arranged as hierarchical tiers. The lowest tier is called the Authority Tier and the other tiers are called the Near Cache. Most frequently used data is stored in the fastest caching tier (top layer)\nTypes of store On-Heap Store - stores cache entries in Java heap memory Off-Heap Store - primary memory (RAM) to store cache entries, cache entries will be moved to the on-heap memory automatically before they can be used. Disk Store - uses a hard disk to store cache entries. SSD type disk would perform better. Clustered Store - stores cache entries on the remote server Types of caching Read-Cache-aside - Application queries the cache. If the data is found, it returns the data directly. If not it fetches the data from the SoR, stores it into the cache, and then returns. Read-Through - Application queries the cache, cache service queries the SoR if not present and updates the cache and returns. Write-Around - Application writes to db and to the cache. Write-Behind / Write-Back - Application writes to cache. Cache is pushed to SoR after some delay periodically. Write-through - Application writes to cache, cache service immediately writes to SoR.

This provides loose coupling. Support of external system - Adapters for ftp,file system, rabbitMQ and other external systems. A higher level of abstraction over Spring’s support for remoting, messaging, and scheduling is provided so that developers dont have to write the code to interact with these systems but focus only on the business logic. At any point if the source changes from a file system to an ftp server, the changes required will be very minimal.\nSpring integration provides different ways to configure:\nXML approach to wire Bean annotation approach Java DSL approach (We will focus on DSL approach as its easier to read and maintain) Terminology Message - Wrapper that can wrap a java object, contains payload \u0026amp; headers Message Channel - A conduit for transmitting messages between producers \u0026amp; consumers a. Point-to-Point channel - one consumer should receive each message from a channel b. Publish/Subscribe channel - Will broadcast the message to any subscriber listening to that channel. Message Transform Message Filter Message Router - Determines what channel or channels (if any) should receive the message next Message Bridge - Connects two message channels or channel adapters Splitter Aggregator Handle - ServiceActivator that handle the message. Adapter endpoints - Provide one-way integration. Gateway endpoints - Provide two-way request/response integration. Types of Message Channel: PollableChannel - Store messages, You need to ask for messages by polling i.e call receive method\na. QueueChannel - Pollable, FIFO, Channel has multiple consumers, only one of them will receive, can be made blocking. b. PriorityChannel - Pollable, Messages to be ordered within the channel based on priority, Channel has multiple consumers, only one of them will receive, can be made blocking. c. RendezvousChannel - Pollable, Synchronous, Similar to QueueChannel but zero capacity to buffer, direct-handoff scenario, wherein a sender blocks until consumer invokes the channel’s receive() method\nSubscribableChannel - Event driven, need to subscribe to get the messages. i.e call the subscribe method.\na. Direct Channel - Subscribable, single subscriber, single thread behaviour blocking the sender thread until the message is subscribed. b. Publish Subscribe Channel - Subscribable, many subscribers, all will get the message. c. FixedSubscriberChannel - Subscribable, single subscriber, subscriber that cannot be unsubscribed\nExecutorChannel - Delegates to an instance of TaskExecutor to perform the dispatch\nFluxChannel - Allows reactive consumption\nCode 1package com.demo.project97.integration;

It allows partial fetch of data, you can use a single endpoint to fetch different formats of data.\nGithub: https://github.com/gitorko/project96\nSpring Boot GraphQL Lets say you have a rest api that returns customer profile, the customer profile has 200+ fields, so a mobile device may not need all the fields, it may need may be 5 fields like name, address etc. Requesting a big payload over wire is costly. So now you end up writing a rest endpoint that returns just the 5 fields. This can become overwhelming when the requirements increase and you end up creating different endpoint for such requirement. In GraphQL you define a schema and let the user/consumer decide which fields they want to fetch.\nBefore GraphQL 1.0 was Released spring had to extend the classes GraphQLMutationResolver, GraphQLQueryResolver. Its no longer required.\nGraphQLMutationResolver -\u0026gt; @MutationMapping\nGraphQLQueryResolver -\u0026gt; @QueryMapping\nThe code uses Extended Scalars for graphql-java to support Date and other type objects in GraphQL The code shows how pagination can be done in GraphQL\nCode 1package com.demo.project96.controller;

The running count should be accurate with no race conditions. Storing of votes is not required, objective is just to track live counts. Who voted to which candidate information need not be stored. Only 2 candidates in the voting system, cats vs dogs. The display should show the live count of votes as they are cast without having the user refresh each time. Display must provide UI to vote for candidates, as well as support api based voting. Non-Functional Requirements Latency should be low. System should be highly available. System should scale well when number of users increases Handle concurrent request and counter value consistent. Future The design can further be modified to use write-back cache to write the running counter to the database. This way we avoid loosing the votes in case redis server goes down. Redis supports AOF (append-only file), which copies write commands to disk as they happen, and snapshotting, which takes the data as it exists at one moment in time and writes it to disk The votes can be persisted to the db by using a queuing mechanism. This will persist the who voted for whom information. We use a queue to keep the latency low. As soon as the vote counter is increased the vote object is queued and a consumer service will dequeue the request and persist to the db. Authentication and user tracking can be added. The project can be changed to spring reactor to make use of non blocking framework. Unsubscribe flow needs to be handled when browser is closed Design We will use Redis to count the votes, this will help us scale well. The counter increment needs to be atomic in nature. Redis provides this feature out of the box, where there is less contention among threads when updating atomic long. We will not persist the votes to a database as the objective is to keep an active running counter. Adding a database in the synchronous call introduces latency which prevent scaling the application. The backend and frontend bundle into a single uber jar that can be deployed on many servers there by providing ability to horizontally scale. We will use SSE (server sent events) to stream the voting results to the app. This way the live counter will always be displayed. We will use angular clarity for the UI Redis is an open-source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis provides data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has built-in data structures, atomic commands, and time-to-live (TTL) capabilities that can be used to power metering use cases. Redis runs on a single thread. Therefore, all of the database updates are serialized, enabling Redis to perform as a lock-free data store. This simplifies the application design as developers don’t need to spend any effort on synchronizing the threads or implementing locking mechanisms for data consistency. Redis stores integers as a base-10 64-bit signed integer. Therefore the maximum limit for an integer is a very large number: 263 – 1 = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

Set ensured that unique elements are stored but how does the set know that both these objects are same? That's why you need to override equals and hashcode.

Remove setter method Make variables final so that they can be init only via constructor. Defensive copy of any variables that return reference objects. Deep copy vs shallow copy difference is important here. Reflection can still break immutability. Puzzle: 6 (string pool vs heap) What is the output of the program?\n1package com.demo.basics.puzzle._006_datatype; 2 3import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; 4 5public class DataTypePuzzle { 6 7 @Test 8 public void test1() { 9 String name1 = \u0026#34;Jack\u0026#34;; 10 String name2 = new String(\u0026#34;Jack\u0026#34;); 11 System.out.println(name1 == name2); 12 System.out.println(name2.equals(name1)); 13 } 14 15 @Test 16 public void test2() { 17 long num1 = 5l; 18 Long num2 = Long.valueOf(5); 19 System.out.println(num1 == num2); 20 System.out.println(num2.equals(num1)); 21 } 22 23 @Test 24 public void test3() { 25 String name1 = new String(\u0026#34;Jack\u0026#34;); 26 String name2 = name1.intern(); 27 System.out.println(name1 == name2); 28 System.out.println(name2.equals(name1)); 29 } 30 31} Solution\nThe String pool holds the strings, using new String() creates the string in heap. The difference between == and .equals() where the first checks the address and the second checks the value. To move an element from heap to string pool we use intern. As a follow up to this, why we shouldn't store/use password as string in java instead we should store password as char array? Because string pool objects will remain in memory longer than heap objects. if you create a password in string the string pool will not GC it after the function is done. So the password can remain for a long time. If someone gets a heap dump they can look at the passwords. Hence better to store in char so that object is GC after it goes out of scope.\nPuzzle: 7 (memory leak) What is the output of the program?\n1package com.demo.basics.puzzle._007_map; 2 3import java.util.HashMap; 4import java.util.Map; 5import java.util.Objects; 6 7import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; 8 9public class MapPuzzle { 10 11 @Test 12 public void test() { 13 Map\u0026lt;Employee, Boolean\u0026gt; map = new HashMap\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); 14 Employee e1 = new Employee(\u0026#34;Jack\u0026#34;, 25); 15 map.put(e1, true); 16 e1.name = \u0026#34;Rose\u0026#34;; 17 Employee e2 = new Employee(\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, 28); 18 map.put(e2, true); 19 20 Employee john = new Employee(\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, 28); 21 Employee jack = new Employee(\u0026#34;Rose\u0026#34;, 25); 22 Employee rose = new Employee(\u0026#34;Jack\u0026#34;, 25); 23 24 System.out.println(map.size()); 25 System.out.println(map.get(john)); 26 System.out.println(map.get(jack)); 27 System.out.println(map.get(rose)); 28 } 29 30 class Employee { 31 public String name; 32 public Integer age; 33 34 public Employee(String name, Integer age) { 35 this.name = name; 36 this.age = age; 37 } 38 39 @Override 40 public boolean equals(Object o) { 41 if (this == o) return true; 42 if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false; 43 Employee employee = (Employee) o; 44 return name.equals(employee.name) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; age.equals(employee.age); 45 } 46 47 @Override 48 public int hashCode() { 49 return Objects.hash(name, age); 50 } 51 } 52} Solution\nJava has automatic memory management in terms of garbage collection unlike c/c++, hence ideally it means that there should be no memory leak, logic being garbage collector always identifies the objects that are not used and garbage collected. The puzzle above is a clear example of a memory leak in Java. The key of a Map has to be immutable, this is one of the hard requirements for a map. If you see someone using an object as key without equals/hashcode you raise a red flag. If the object is not immutable and used as a key in map you raise a red flag.\nHashmap is a array with each node of array pointing to a linkedlist. Jack was put on the hashmap table, but the value was changed to Rose. Rose hashcode will never point to the bucket of Jack. Jack hashcode will point to the bucket where Rose is present but then when it reaches that node it will again check if objects are same, in this case its not, so it will return null. So you will never be able to get jack. This is an example of memory leak in java. If it happens for many elements then jvm will crash. Garbage collector cant clean it because its still part of the map, but no one can reach it.\nPuzzle: 8 (ThreadLocal) What is the output of the program?\n1package com.demo.basics.puzzle._008_threadlocal; 2 3import java.text.ParseException; 4import java.text.SimpleDateFormat; 5import java.util.Arrays; 6import java.util.Date; 7import java.util.List; 8import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch; 9import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService; 10import java.util.concurrent.Executors; 11 12import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; 13 14public class ThreadPuzzle { 15 16 SimpleDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(\u0026#34;dd/MM/yyyy\u0026#34;); 17 18 @Test 19 public void test() { 20 List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; joinDates = Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;01/01/2015\u0026#34;, 21 \u0026#34;01/01/2016\u0026#34;, 22 \u0026#34;01/01/2017\u0026#34;, 23 \u0026#34;01/01/2018\u0026#34;, 24 \u0026#34;01/01/2019\u0026#34; 25 ); 26 CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(joinDates.size()); 27 ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(); 28 for (String doj : joinDates) { 29 executor.execute(() -\u0026gt; { 30 try { 31 Date dojDt = df.parse(doj); 32 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Saving : \u0026#34; + dojDt); 33 } catch (ParseException e) { 34 //e.printStackTrace(); 35 } finally { 36 latch.countDown(); 37 } 38 }); 39 } 40 try { 41 latch.await(); 42 } catch (InterruptedException e) { 43 e.printStackTrace(); 44 } 45 } 46} Solution\nThe program will work sometimes and will fail sometimes. Reason is SimpleDateFormat is not thread safe. The same object is sent to all threads and even though it looks like they are using SimpleDateFormat to just parse, internally SimpleDateFormat does few operation that are not thread safe. So now you might think i will pass a new SimpleDateFormat to each thread. However this is a costly object that will increase memory. This is where ThreadLocal comes into picture, Threadlocal will keep a copy of the object specific to that thread.\nWhat is the difference between copy of SimpleDateFormat vs using new SimpleDateFormat() each time? Copy objects will be == number of threads new objects will be \u0026gt; number of threads. So if you have 10K dates, you will end up creating 10k new objects if you do new() With ThreadLocal you will at max have 5 SimpleDateFormat objects if the thread pool is of size 5.\nThis is the advantage of using ThreadLocal.\nPuzzle: 9 (AtomicLong vs LongAdder) What is the output of the program?\n1package com.demo.basics.puzzle._009_counter; 2 3import java.util.ArrayList; 4import java.util.List; 5import java.util.concurrent.Callable; 6import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService; 7import java.util.concurrent.Executors; 8import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; 9 10import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; 11 12public class CounterPuzzle { 13 14 @Test 15 public void test() throws InterruptedException { 16 Job job = new Job(); 17 job.runJob(); 18 System.out.println(job.counter); 19 } 20 21 class Job { 22 long counter = 0l; 23 24 public void runJob() throws InterruptedException { 25 ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(); 26 List\u0026lt;Callable\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt;\u0026gt; tasks = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); 27 for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 250; i++) { 28 tasks.add(() -\u0026gt; { 29 counter = counter + 1; 30 return null; 31 }); 32 } 33 executor.invokeAll(tasks, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS); 34 executor.shutdown(); 35 } 36 } 37} Solution\nThere are 2 problem in the code above. Each thread is updating counter without syncronization block/lock, so what value the thread read and what value it wrote back is not guaranteed. Your first thought might be to make the variable volatile so that copy of counter is kept in main memory and not thread memory. However if every thread is reading and writing at different times even volatile wont help. So you might think of putting a syncronization block but that will impact performance. So using a AtomicLong is a good approach here. It guarantees that the CAS (Compare and Swap) operation is atomic and hence counter will be correct. There is another hidden problem that is long + 1 is not a single operation. integer + 1 is a single operation, but long + 1 is not a single operation even within jvm. So this can lead to race condition. Long + 1 takes 2 operation in JVM to add. The AtomicLong solves the problem but again is not optimal as it can lead to contention when there are lot of requests. This is when you use LongAdder which also guarantees count is 250 but the way it does it is different. LongAdder maintains an array of counters, each thread updates a different element in the array with the count +1 and when you finally call sum, it adds the array. This means there is no contention because each thread is writing to a different block.\nPuzzle: 10 (volatile vs AtomicBoolean) What is the output of the program?\n1package com.demo.basics.puzzle._010_volatile; 2 3import java.time.Duration; 4import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; 5 6import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions; 7import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; 8 9public class VolatilePuzzle { 10 11 private boolean sayHello = false; 12 13 @Test 14 public void test() { 15 Assertions.assertTimeoutPreemptively(Duration.ofSeconds(3), () -\u0026gt; { 16 //sayHello(); 17 }); 18 } 19 20 public void sayHello() throws InterruptedException { 21 Thread thread = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; { 22 while (!sayHello) { 23 } 24 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;); 25 while (sayHello) { 26 } 27 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Good Bye!\u0026#34;); 28 }); 29 thread.start(); 30 TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1); 31 sayHello = true; 32 TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1); 33 sayHello = false; 34 thread.join(); 35 } 36} Solution\nThe puzzle explains the concept of thread memory cache. When you call a thread it creates a thread stack that maintains a copy of the global variable. If the variable changes within the thread the changes are flushed, however if the variable changes outside the changes will not be synchronised immediately. Thread can continue to use the local copy of the variable not knowing that it has already changed. In the puzzle above even though we are change the boolean, the thread doesnt know the boolean changed in the main thread so it continues to refer to its local copy in cache. How to prevent the thread from maintaining a local copy of the variable cache and always refer to global variable? You can use volatile or AtomicBoolean\nPuzzle: 11 (instance lock vs class lock) What is the output of the program?\n1package com.demo.basics.puzzle._011_instanceclasslock; 2 3import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService; 4import java.util.concurrent.Executors; 5import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; 6 7import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; 8 9public class InstanceClassLockPuzzle { 10 11 @Test 12 public void test() throws InterruptedException { 13 Greet greet = new Greet(); 14 ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(); 15 executor.execute(() -\u0026gt; { 16 greet.task1(); 17 }); 18 TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(2); 19 executor.execute(() -\u0026gt; { 20 greet.task2(); 21 }); 22 executor.execute(() -\u0026gt; { 23 greet.task2(); 24 }); 25 executor.shutdown(); 26 executor.awaitTermination(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); 27 } 28 29 class Greet { 30 31 public void task1() { 32 synchronized (Greet.class) { 33 System.out.println(\u0026#34;task1 class lock acquired!\u0026#34;); 34 while (true) ; 35 } 36 } 37 38 public void task2() { 39 synchronized (this) { 40 System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \u0026#34; task2 instance lock acquired!\u0026#34;); 41 try { 42 TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(2); 43 } catch (InterruptedException e) { 44 e.printStackTrace(); 45 } 46 System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \u0026#34; task2 completed\u0026#34;); 47 } 48 } 49 } 50} 51 52 Solution\nThere are 2 types of locks instance lock and class lock.\nPuzzle: 13 (Double check locking) What is the problem with this program?\n1package com.demo.basics.puzzle._013_doublechecklock; 2 3import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; 4 5public class CheckLockingPuzzle { 6 7 @Test 8 public void test() { 9 CheckLockingPuzzle.getInstance().greet(); 10 } 11 12 private static volatile CheckLockingPuzzle instance; 13 14 private CheckLockingPuzzle() { 15 } 16 17 private static CheckLockingPuzzle getInstance() { 18 synchronized (CheckLockingPuzzle.class) { 19 if (instance == null) { 20 instance = new CheckLockingPuzzle(); 21 } 22 } 23 return instance; 24 } 25 26 public void greet() { 27 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;); 28 } 29} Solution\nIntroduces the concept of double check locking, where each thread accessing the syncronized block is a costly operation, hence doing a null check before and after the syncronization improves performance.\nPuzzle: 14 (Race Condition) What is the problem with this program?\n1package com.demo.basics.puzzle._014_racecondition; 2 3import java.util.ArrayList; 4import java.util.HashMap; 5import java.util.List; 6import java.util.Map; 7import java.util.concurrent.Callable; 8import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService; 9import java.util.concurrent.Executors; 10import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; 11 12import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; 13 14public class RacePuzzle { 15 16 Map\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; bookMap = new HashMap\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); 17 18 @Test 19 public void test() throws InterruptedException { 20 ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(); 21 List\u0026lt;Callable\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt;\u0026gt; tasks = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); 22 tasks.add(() -\u0026gt; { 23 if (!bookMap.containsKey(\u0026#34;book1\u0026#34;)) { 24 bookMap.put(\u0026#34;book1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;user3\u0026#34;); 25 } 26 return null; 27 }); 28 tasks.add(() -\u0026gt; { 29 if (!bookMap.containsKey(\u0026#34;book1\u0026#34;)) { 30 bookMap.put(\u0026#34;book1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;user5\u0026#34;); 31 } 32 return null; 33 }); 34 executor.invokeAll(tasks, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS); 35 System.out.println(bookMap.get(\u0026#34;book1\u0026#34;)); 36 } 37} Solution\nRace condition, two threads can try to update at the same time leading to data corruption.

Kafka as queue (point-point) messaging system. Kafka as stream processing system that reacts to event in realtime. Kafka as a store for data. Kafka stores streams of records (messages) in topics. Topics are partitioned and replicated across multiple nodes thus kafka can scale and be a distributed system. Producers publish data to the topics. Consumer groups can subscribe to topics.\nData Store - Kafka is append only commit log. Which means it can also act as a data store. Queue (point-point) - If only one consumer group subscribes to a topic it behaves like a Queue (point-point) messaging system. Pub-Sub - If more than one consumer group subscribe to a topic it behaves like Pub-Sub messaging system. Consumer Group - Number of consumers in a group must be less than or equal to number of partitions. Cant have more consumers in a group than there are partitions. Partition - Producer needs to be aware of the partition its publishing to. Partition - When you add a new kafka broker the partition is replicated so loss of one node doesnt crash the system. Ordering - Ordering of messages is guaranteed only in a partition and not across partitions. Offset - Consumer can choose to read records from latest or from beginning. Long polling - Uses poll model compared to RabbitMQ which uses push model Adapters - Provides adapters that can be used to write data to db and other endpoints Stream - Provides stream processing capabilities Similar to spring rest template or jdbc template which abstracts the rest/jdbc calls spring provides kafka template which provides high level abstraction to interact with kafka. There is an even higher level of abstraction provided by spring cloud stream which lets we integrate with kafka or rabbitmq and other messaging systems. So when the messaging systems changes you dont need to make code changes in producer or consumer.\nKafka Producer \u0026amp; Consumer 1package com.demo.project80.producer; 2 3import java.util.Arrays; 4import java.util.List; 5import java.util.Random; 6import java.util.UUID; 7import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; 8 9import com.demo.project80.pojo.User; 10import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor; 11import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j; 12import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord; 13import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value; 14import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner; 15import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; 16import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; 17import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; 18import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate; 19 20@SpringBootApplication 21@Slf4j 22@RequiredArgsConstructor 23public class KafkaProducer { 24 25 @Value(value = \u0026#34;${topic.name}\u0026#34;) 26 private String topicName; 27 28 private final KafkaTemplate\u0026lt;String, User\u0026gt; kafkaTemplate; 29 30 @Bean 31 public CommandLineRunner sendData() { 32 return args -\u0026gt; { 33 List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; users = Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;david\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;john\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;raj\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;peter\u0026#34;); 34 Random random = new Random(); 35 while (true) { 36 User user = new User(users.get(random.nextInt(users.size())), random.nextInt(100)); 37 ProducerRecord\u0026lt;String, User\u0026gt; producerRecord = new ProducerRecord\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(topicName, user); 38 producerRecord.headers().add(\u0026#34;message-id\u0026#34;, UUID.randomUUID().toString().getBytes()); 39 log.info(\u0026#34;Sending user: {}\u0026#34;, user); 40 kafkaTemplate.send(producerRecord); 41 TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(10); 42 } 43 }; 44 } 45 46 public static void main(String[] args) { 47 SpringApplication.run(KafkaProducer.class, args); 48 } 49 50} 1package com.demo.project80.consumer; 2 3import com.demo.project80.pojo.User; 4import lombok.SneakyThrows; 5import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j; 6import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord; 7import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; 8import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; 9import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener; 10 11@SpringBootApplication 12@Slf4j 13public class KafkaConsumer { 14 15 @SneakyThrows 16 @KafkaListener(id = \u0026#34;my-client-app\u0026#34;, topics = \u0026#34;${topic.name}\u0026#34;) 17 public void topicConsumer(ConsumerRecord\u0026lt;String, User\u0026gt; consumerRecord) { 18 User user = consumerRecord.value(); 19 log.info(\u0026#34;Received User : {}\u0026#34;, user); 20 } 21 22 public static void main(String[] args) { 23 SpringApplication.run(KafkaConsumer.class, args); 24 } 25 26} 1spring: 2 main: 3 banner-mode: \u0026#34;off\u0026#34; 4 web-application-type: none 5 kafka: 6 bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092 7 consumer: 8 client-id: my-client-consumer 9 group-id: group-01 10 auto-offset-reset: earliest 11 key-deserializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer 12 value-deserializer: com.demo.project80.converter.MessageDeserializer 13 producer: 14 client-id: my-client-app 15 key-serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer 16 value-serializer: com.demo.project80.converter.MessageSerializer 17 #value-serializer: org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonSerializer 18topic: 19 name: mytopic.000 1version: \u0026#39;2\u0026#39; 2services: 3 zookeeper: 4 container_name: zookeeper 5 image: \u0026#39;bitnami/zookeeper:latest\u0026#39; 6 ports: 7 - 2181:2181 8 environment: 9 - ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LOGIN=yes 10 kafkaserver: 11 hostname: kafkaserver 12 container_name: kafkaserver 13 image: \u0026#39;bitnami/kafka:latest\u0026#39; 14 ports: 15 - 9092:9092 16 depends_on: 17 - zookeeper 18 environment: 19 - KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:2181 20 - KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME=kafkaserver 21 - ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER=yes 22 links: 23 - zookeeper:zookeeper 24 kafka-ui: 25 container_name: kafka-ui 26 image: provectuslabs/kafka-ui:latest 27 ports: 28 - 9090:8080 29 depends_on: 30 - zookeeper 31 - kafkaserver 32 environment: 33 KAFKA_CLUSTERS_0_NAME: local 34 KAFKA_CLUSTERS_0_BOOTSTRAPSERVERS: kafkaserver:9092 35 KAFKA_CLUSTERS_0_ZOOKEEPER: zookeeper:2181 Run the main method of producer and then the consumer.\nThe group id of your client which uses group management to assign topic partitions to consumers, auto-offset-reset=earliest ensures the new consumer group will get the oldest available message.\nwe can have multiple kafka listener for a topic with different group id A consumer can listen to more than one topic.

Tables are a set of evolving facts. Each new event overwrites the old one, whereas streams are a collection of immutable facts. Kafka Streams provides two abstractions for Streams and Tables. KStream handles the stream of records. KTable manages the changelog stream with the latest state of a given key For not partitioned tables we can use GlobalKTables to broadcast information to all tasks.\nWhen we use other projects like apache spark, storm,flink we write code and copy the jar to the nodes where the actual work happens. With the introduction of kafka stream we can now write your processing logic for streams and then it can run anywhere the jar can run. KafkaStreams enables us to consume from Kafka topics, analyze or transform data, and potentially, send it to another Kafka topic.\nWe will now count the users by age group.\n1package com.demo.project80.stream; 2 3import java.util.Properties; 4 5import com.demo.project80.pojo.User; 6import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j; 7import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serde; 8import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serdes; 9import org.apache.kafka.streams.KafkaStreams; 10import org.apache.kafka.streams.KeyValue; 11import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsBuilder; 12import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsConfig; 13import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.Consumed; 14import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.Grouped; 15import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.KStream; 16import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.KTable; 17import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value; 18import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner; 19import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; 20import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; 21import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; 22import org.springframework.context.annotation.Profile; 23import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaStreamsDefaultConfiguration; 24import org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonSerde; 25 26@SpringBootApplication 27@Slf4j 28public class KafkaStream { 29 30 @Value(value = \u0026#34;${topic.name}\u0026#34;) 31 private String topicName; 32 33 private static final Serde\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; STRING_SERDE = Serdes.String(); 34 35 @Bean 36 public CommandLineRunner streamData() { 37 return args -\u0026gt; { 38 StreamsBuilder streamsBuilder = new StreamsBuilder(); 39 KStream\u0026lt;String, User\u0026gt; streamOfUsers = streamsBuilder 40 .stream(topicName, Consumed.with(STRING_SERDE, new JsonSerde\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(User.class))); 41 42 streamOfUsers.foreach((k, v) -\u0026gt; { 43 log.info(\u0026#34;user: {}, age: {}\u0026#34;, v.getName(), v.getAge()); 44 }); 45 46 KTable\u0026lt;String, Long\u0026gt; employeeCountByCompany = streamOfUsers 47 .map((k, v) -\u0026gt; new KeyValue\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(v.getAge(), String.valueOf(v.getAge()))) 48 .groupBy((k, w) -\u0026gt; w, Grouped.with(STRING_SERDE, STRING_SERDE)) 49 .count(); 50 employeeCountByCompany.toStream().foreach((w, c) -\u0026gt; log.info(\u0026#34;Age: \u0026#34; + w + \u0026#34; -\u0026gt; \u0026#34; + c)); 51 52 KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(streamsBuilder.build(), kStreamsConfigs()); 53 streams.cleanUp(); 54 streams.start(); 55 Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(streams::close)); 56 }; 57 } 58 59 @Bean(name = KafkaStreamsDefaultConfiguration.DEFAULT_STREAMS_CONFIG_BEAN_NAME) 60 public Properties kStreamsConfigs() { 61 Properties props = new Properties(); 62 props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, \u0026#34;test-group\u0026#34;); 63 props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, \u0026#34;localhost:9092\u0026#34;); 64 return props; 65 } 66 67 public static void main(String[] args) { 68 SpringApplication.run(KafkaStream.class, args); 69 } 70 71} Run the main method of KafkaStream.\nSetup Project 80 Spring Boot \u0026amp; Kafka\nhttps://gitorko.github.io/spring-apache-kafka/\nVersion Check version\n1$java --version 2openjdk 17.0.3 2022-04-19 LTS Kafka To run kafka we need zookeeper, use the docker compose command to run kafka as a container\nFor windows ensure the C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts file has these 2 entries.

To fetch information from the server continuously we can use the following approaches.\nShort-Polling - Client continuously asks the server for new data. Long-Polling - Client continuously asks the server for new data, but server waits for a few seconds and if data becomes available by then it will return the data. Websocket - HTTP connection is upgraded to bidirectional connection. Server Sent Events - HTTP connection is kept open by the server and data is pushed to client continuously over it. Websocket Server Sent Event Long-Poll Full-duplex,Bidirectional Half-duplex,Unidirectional Half-duplex,Unidirectional Server Push \u0026amp; Client Send Server Push Client Pull Text + Binary Text Text + Binary 65,536 (max number of TCP ports) 6-8 parallel per domain Based on threads available Connect will open the websocket connection \u0026amp; disconnect should terminate the session. Two users should be able to send and receive messages. Design Code You can enable plain websockets via @EnableWebSocket however in the example below we are using STOMP over WebSocket protocol by using @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker. STOMP is a subprotocol operating on top of the lower-level WebSocket. Here we create an in-memory message broker for sending and receiving messages. Instead of the annotation @SendTo, you can also use SimpMessagingTemplate which you can autowire inside your controller.\n1package com.demo.project92.controller; 2 3import java.time.LocalDateTime; 4 5import com.demo.project92.domain.ChatMessage;

Here we will use it to setup a data pipeline that can be used to orchestrate data processing jobs.\nGithub: https://github.com/gitorko/project84\nRequirement Lets consider a company sells paint.\nSTAGE1: They get their orders from the field in file format to their FTP server. This has to be processed and uploaded to the db. As these are large files ability re-run jobs after fixing files is required. STAGE2: They receive their material supplier in file format to their FTP server. This has to be processed and uploaded to the db. As these are large files ability re-run jobs after fixing files is required. STAGE3: Once the order and material is uploaded to db, if the order can be fulfilled the paint color and quantity need to be grouped by city. STAGE4: Additional buffer needs to be added to cover any shortages. This job is a small job and can be run in parallel. STAGE5: Sales rep bonus point need to be added in case the offer is active. This job is a small job and can be run in parallel. STAGE6: Order needs to be sent to factory in each city. The features of jenkins that make it friendly for data processing are:\nLog view - Ability to look at logs across different stages Graph view - Ability to look at a run graphically. Input - Ability to provide input to job at run time. Scheduling - Ability to schedule jobs at periodic interval. Parallel execution - Ability to run jobs in parallel Agents load distribution - Ability to run the job on other agent machines distributing the load. Time to complete - Ability to see which job is running and history of runs. Time taken - Ability to view each stage time taken over long periods to identify trends in execution. Re-Run - Ability to re-run a particular stage of the failed job. Slack - Ability to notify users on slack after job completion. Pull from maven - Ability to download the jar from maven. Plugin support - Numerous plugin are available for jenkins. Code The backend job that needs to do the processing. It takes the input as arguments and processes each stage and writes the results to a postgres db.\nEnsure that each job can run in isolation and updates just one table. 2 stages should never update the same table. Ensure that it throws runtime exception in case of failure. Ensure logging is correctly added to identify the issue. Ensure the stage can be re-run many times. This is done by resetting the data. Change the value of BASE_PATH accordingly. 1package com.demo.project84; 2 3import java.io.BufferedReader; 4import java.io.Serializable; 5import java.nio.file.Files; 6import java.nio.file.Path; 7import java.nio.file.Paths; 8import java.time.LocalDate; 9import java.util.HashMap; 10import java.util.List; 11import java.util.Map; 12import javax.persistence.Column; 13import javax.persistence.Entity; 14import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue; 15import javax.persistence.GenerationType; 16import javax.persistence.Id; 17 18import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; 19import lombok.Builder; 20import lombok.Data; 21import lombok.NoArgsConstructor; 22import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor; 23import lombok.SneakyThrows; 24import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j; 25import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner; 26import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; 27import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; 28import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository; 29 30@SpringBootApplication 31@RequiredArgsConstructor 32@Slf4j 33public class Main implements CommandLineRunner { 34 private static final String BASE_PATH = \u0026#34;/Users/asurendra/code/pet/project84/\u0026#34;; 35 36 final OrderRepo orderRepo; 37 final MaterialRepo materialRepo; 38 final ProcessedRepo processedRepo; 39 final BonusRepo bonusRepo; 40 final FactoryRepo factoryRepo; 41 42 public static void main(String[] args) { 43 SpringApplication.run(Main.class, args); 44 } 45 46 @Override 47 public void run(String... args) throws Exception { 48 String caseType = args[0]; 49 switch (caseType) { 50 case \u0026#34;STAGE1\u0026#34;: 51 stage1(); 52 break; 53 case \u0026#34;STAGE2\u0026#34;: 54 stage2(); 55 break; 56 case \u0026#34;STAGE3\u0026#34;: 57 stage3(); 58 break; 59 case \u0026#34;STAGE4\u0026#34;: 60 stage4(); 61 break; 62 case \u0026#34;STAGE5\u0026#34;: 63 stage5(); 64 break; 65 case \u0026#34;STAGE6\u0026#34;: 66 stage6(); 67 break; 68 default: 69 throw new IllegalStateException(\u0026#34;Unexpected value: \u0026#34; + caseType); 70 } 71 } 72 73 /** 74 * Load order file to db. 75 */ 76 @SneakyThrows 77 private void stage1() { 78 log.info(\u0026#34;Loading orders to db\u0026#34;); 79 try { 80 orderRepo.deleteAll(); 81 Path path = Paths.get(BASE_PATH + \u0026#34;order-file.txt\u0026#34;); 82 try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) { 83 while (reader.ready()) { 84 String line = reader.readLine(); 85 log.info(line); 86 String[] split = line.split(\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;); 87 OrderDetail order = OrderDetail.builder() 88 .color(split[0]) 89 .quantity(Double.valueOf(split[1])) 90 .city(split[2]) 91 .salesRep(split[3]) 92 .orderDate(LocalDate.parse(split[4])) 93 .build(); 94 orderRepo.save(order); 95 } 96 } 97 log.info(\u0026#34;Loading orders completed\u0026#34;); 98 } catch (Exception ex) { 99 log.error(\u0026#34;ERROR: stage1\u0026#34;, ex); 100 throw new RuntimeException(\u0026#34;ERROR: stage1\u0026#34;); 101 } 102 } 103 104 /** 105 * Load material file to db. 106 */ 107 @SneakyThrows 108 private void stage2() { 109 log.info(\u0026#34;Loading materials to db\u0026#34;); 110 try { 111 materialRepo.deleteAll(); 112 Path path = Paths.get(BASE_PATH + \u0026#34;material-file.txt\u0026#34;); 113 try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) { 114 while (reader.ready()) { 115 String line = reader.readLine(); 116 log.info(line); 117 String[] split = line.split(\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;); 118 MaterialDetail material = MaterialDetail.builder() 119 .color(split[0]) 120 .quantity(Double.valueOf(split[1])) 121 .orderDate(LocalDate.parse(split[2])) 122 .build(); 123 materialRepo.save(material); 124 } 125 } 126 log.info(\u0026#34;Loading orders completed\u0026#34;); 127 } catch (Exception ex) { 128 log.error(\u0026#34;ERROR: stage2\u0026#34;, ex); 129 throw new RuntimeException(\u0026#34;ERROR: stage2\u0026#34;); 130 } 131 } 132 133 /** 134 * Process orders if it can be fulfilled. 135 */ 136 private void stage3() { 137 log.info(\u0026#34;Processing orders\u0026#34;); 138 try { 139 processedRepo.deleteAll(); 140 bonusRepo.deleteAll(); 141 factoryRepo.deleteAll(); 142 Map\u0026lt;String, Double\u0026gt; cache = new HashMap\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); 143 materialRepo.findAll().forEach(m -\u0026gt; { 144 cache.put(m.getColor(), m.getQuantity()); 145 }); 146 Map\u0026lt;String, Double\u0026gt; result = new HashMap\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); 147 List\u0026lt;OrderDetail\u0026gt; orders = orderRepo.findAll(); 148 for (OrderDetail order : orders) { 149 Double balance = cache.get(order.getColor()); 150 if (order.getQuantity() \u0026lt; balance) { 151 balance = balance - order.getQuantity(); 152 cache.put(order.getColor(), balance); 153 String key = order.getColor() + \u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + order.getCity(); 154 Double count = result.containsKey(key) ?

Users should not be able to add to cart before that. There will be large number of users requesting to add the item to the cart at the specific moment in time. The items will be limited in stock. The 'add to cart' action must be honored in the order they were received. The first user to click on add to cart must get the item. As long as there are products each user requesting should get the item in the cart. Once the item is added to the cart rest of the process of checkout is beyond scope of this demo. A user can get just one item they should not be able to buy more than one item. User must be able to delete the item from the cart after which it should be available for other users. The authentication can be mocked to randomly assign a user to each browser instance. So each time you open the url in a different browser/tab it is assigned a unique user. User can logout and it will assign a new user. Non-Functional Requirements Latency to place the request should be low. System should be highly available \u0026amp; be able to handle burst of request traffic in short duration. System should scale well when number of users increases Design We will use a rabbitmq to queue the incoming burst of requests. Each request response time window will be kept as minimal as possible to avoid crashing the system under heavy load. Each user after placing the request to add to cart will be in wait state and query the status of his request. The backend and frontend bundle into a single uber jar that can be deployed on many servers there by providing ability to horizontally scale. The max limit of requests that can be served by a single instance then depend on the default tomcat thread pool size of 200 and the server configurations. If the user tries to book the item before sale begin date, it will fail. Add to cart will work only after the sale begins.\nIf the same user tries to book the item in 2 tabs only one will succeed, one user can buy only 1 item in the sale.\nTwo users can try to book the item at the same time each will be alloted a different item if its available.\nAfter adding item to cart user can remove the item from cart.\nAfter adding an item the client waits for the action to complete.\nCode 1package com.demo.project90.controller;

The resources of the system are\nTomcat server has default 200 worker threads. Each 'add to cart' request takes average 20 ms for the above resources. 200/0.02 = 10,000 requests can be handled per second. Reducing this by load factor due to GC and context switching of 0.8 (80%) gives us 10000 x 0.8 = 8000 requests per second.\nThis setup can be deployed on multi node scenario, as the tokens are fetched from RabbitMQ queue it will scale on a distributed setup. Further optimization can be done by having region dedicated queue sharding and region specific event processor.\nFor authenticated sessions DOS (Denial Of Service) attacks are not a concern, if you still need to ensure against DOS attacks you can use a Captcha.\nOnce you add more servers to handle the request the bottleneck shifts to RabbitMQ capability to handle load and we can then explore clustering in RabbitMQ. The queue can be made persistent so that events survive a restart.\nReferences https://clarity.design/\nhttps://spring.io/projects/spring-boot\nhttps://www.rabbitmq.com/\nhttps://hackernoon.com/developing-a-flash-sale-system-7481f6ede0a3\n","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/post/flash-sale-system/","section":"post","tags":["flash-sale","rabbitmq","clarity","jmeter","selenium"],"title":"Flash Sale System"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/tags/flash-sale/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"flash-sale"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/categories/jmeter/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"JMeter"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/categories/jpa/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"JPA"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/tags/rabbitmq/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"rabbitmq"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/tags/selenium/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"selenium"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/categories/selenium/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Selenium"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/categories/springboot/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"SpringBoot"},{"body":"Clarity provides Server-Driven DataGrid.

Provide QR code ticket and completes the ticketing flow on admit.\nFunctional Requirements A ticket booking system where users can book tickets. Two users cant book the same ticket. Authentication can be simulated to randomly assign a user to each browser instance. Each browser session considered as a unique user. Logout should assign a new user to the session. User should be able to block a ticket before making payment. Other user should not be able to block the same ticket. If the user doesnt complete the payment in 30 seconds the ticket which is blocked should be released back to the free pool. After blocking a ticket user can cancel the ticket, this should release the ticket back to the free pool. If the user tries to confirm the ticket after blocking wait for 30 seconds the booking should fail. Same user should be able to book the same ticket twice from two different browser sessions. Only user who has blocked the ticket can confirm the ticket. If user is looking at stale data, the ticket is already booked by other user then the transaction should fail. Should generate QR code as ticket Scanning the QR code should indicate that user is admitted into the venue. A single booking can book N tickets. Non-Functional Requirements Latency should be low. System should be highly available. System should scale well when number of users increases. We will use a fixed rate scheduler to release any tickets held for more than 30 seconds. Design We will postgres DB to persist the booking data. We will use optimistic locking as it scales well without locking the db rows. Two users can try to book the same ticket at the same time. It uses optimistic locking to RESERVE a ticket for one user and throws ObjectOptimisticLockingFailureException for the other user.\nWhile the first user is waiting to confirm, if the second user tries to book the same ticket it fails.\nIf the first user doesn't complete the payment confirmation within 30 seconds the lock on the ticket is released. If the first user presses cancel button then also the lock on the RESERVED ticket is released.\nIf the first user tries to confirm the ticket after 30 seconds then the booking fails as ticket is held in RESERVED state for a user only for 30 seconds.\nIf the same user tries to book the same seat from 2 different windows, one will succeed while other will throw error\nBackend api ensure that only user who RESERVED the ticket can book the ticket. So a ticket RESERVED by first user cant be booked by second user.\nIf the second user hasn't refreshed his screen and tries to book already BOOKED tickets it will fail\nQR code is generated for each ticket, clicking on the ticket takes you to the QR code.\nCan also be fetched via postman\nOn scanning the QR code in your mobile and visiting the uri provided the state is marked as entered completing the ticketing flow.\nEntered indicates that user has been admitted to the event on showing the QR code ticket. You can now track who booked the ticket and if they visited the event using the QR code ticket.\nCode 1package com.demo.project87.controller; 2 3import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream; 4import java.io.IOException;

Supports basic integration with spring security and provides login logout support. Uses Spring Data to persist data into the HSQL db. A file based HSQL server db is used so that data persists across restarts. This can easily be changed to in-memory HSQL db. Spring dev tools allow seamless reload on any changes for html and java files so you can view the changes in the browser as soon as you edit them.\nSupports basic login via spring security Bootstrap 5 Login screen CRUD UI for adding and removing customer HSQL db Spring JPA Thymeleaf template Chart.js charts for bar,pie,stack charts with data from rest api Design Code On Intellij to allow spring dev tools to reload on change you need to enable 'Update classes and resources' as shown below\nSpring MVC controller renders the HTML.\n1package com.demo.project79.controller;

You can the publish such traces to the zipkin server which lets you visualize a request across distributed environment. You can then see the latency of each request in a distributed transaction.\nInternally it has 4 modules –\nCollector – Once any component sends the trace data arrives to Zipkin collector daemon, it is validated, stored, and indexed for lookups by the Zipkin collector. Storage – This module store and index the lookup data in backend. Cassandra, ElasticSearch and MySQL are supported. Search – This module provides a simple JSON API for finding and retrieving traces stored in backend. The primary consumer of this API is the Web UI. Web UI – A very nice UI interface for viewing traces.

There are four built-in exchange types\nDirect Exchange – Routes messages to a queue by matching a complete routing key Fanout Exchange – Routes messages to all the queues bound to it Topic Exchange – Routes messages to multiple queues by matching a routing key to a pattern Headers Exchange – Routes messages based on message headers Queues are bound to an exchange using a routing key. Messages are sent to an exchange with a routing key. AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an open standard wire specification for asynchronous message communication, AMQP provides platform-neutral binary protocol standard, hence it can run on different environments \u0026amp; programming languages unlike JMS.\nRemote procedure call (RPC) is a way to invoking a function on another computer and waiting for the result. The call is synchronous and blocking in nature, so the client will wait for the response.\nCode Queue to send and receive messages\n1package com.demo.project78.queue; 2 3import com.demo.project78.config.AmqpConfig;

If the operation was performed on a single JVM you could look at locking but since there are many jvm the locking has to be done at database level.\nGithub: https://github.com/gitorko/project67\nLocking Lets say we have a ticket booking service with a table holding all the free tickets and multiple servers running our app. How do we ensure that 2 users cant book the same seat? Since the app runs on different JVM we cant syncronize or use jvm locks.\nHibernate provides two approaches to handle concurrency at database level:\nPessimistic Locking - The lock is now applied by the database at row level or table level. If the lock is a WRITE lock it prevents other threads from modifying the data. eg: SELECT * from TABLE where id = 1 for update; Optimistic Locking - A version field is introduced to the database table, The JPA ensures that version check is done before saving data, if the version has changed the update will throw Error. Scalability is high with this approach. Pessimistic locking Three Pessimistic LockModeTypes are supported in JPA.\nPESSIMISTIC_READ - Rows are locked and can be read by other transactions, but they cannot be deleted or modified. PESSIMISTIC_READ guarantees repeatable reads. PESSIMISTIC_WRITE - Rows are locked and cannot be read, modified or deleted by other transactions. For PESSIMISTIC_WRITE no phantom reads can occur and access to data must be serialized. PESSIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT - Rows are locked and cannot be modified or deleted. For versioned entities, their version number is incremented as soon as the query executes. 1package com.demo.project67.pessimistic; 2 3import java.util.Date; 4import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService; 5import java.util.concurrent.Executors; 6import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; 7import javax.persistence.Entity; 8import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue; 9import javax.persistence.GenerationType; 10import javax.persistence.Id; 11import javax.persistence.LockModeType; 12import javax.persistence.QueryHint; 13import javax.persistence.Temporal; 14import javax.persistence.TemporalType; 15import javax.transaction.Transactional; 16 17import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; 18import lombok.Builder; 19import lombok.Data; 20import lombok.NoArgsConstructor; 21import net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.Throw; 22import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; 23import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner; 24import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; 25import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration; 26import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; 27import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan; 28import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; 29import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository; 30import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Lock; 31import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.QueryHints; 32import org.springframework.stereotype.Component; 33import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository; 34 35@Configuration 36@EnableAutoConfiguration 37@ComponentScan(basePackages = \u0026#34;com.demo.project67.pessimistic\u0026#34;) 38public class PessimisticMain { 39 40 @Autowired 41 MyService myService; 42 43 ExecutorService pool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(); 44 45 public static void main(String[] args) { 46 SpringApplication.run(PessimisticMain.class, args); 47 } 48 49 @Bean 50 public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner() { 51 return args -\u0026gt; { 52 myService.seedData(); 53 pool.submit(() -\u0026gt; { 54 Boolean status = myService.bookSeat(1, \u0026#34;Joe\u0026#34;); 55 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Booking for Joe success: \u0026#34;+ status); 56 }); 57 pool.submit(() -\u0026gt; { 58 Boolean status = myService.bookSeat(1, \u0026#34;Jack\u0026#34;); 59 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Booking for Jack success: \u0026#34;+ status); 60 }); 61 pool.shutdown(); 62 pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS); 63 myService.showData(); 64 }; 65 } 66} 67 68@Entity 69@Data 70@Builder 71@AllArgsConstructor 72@NoArgsConstructor 73class Ticket { 74 @Id 75 @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) 76 private Long id; 77 private Integer seatNumber; 78 @Temporal(TemporalType.DATE) 79 private Date onDay; 80 private String bookedBy; 81} 82 83@Repository 84interface TicketRepository extends JpaRepository\u0026lt;Ticket, Long\u0026gt; { 85 86 @Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE) 87 @QueryHints({@QueryHint(name = \u0026#34;javax.persistence.lock.timeout\u0026#34;, value = \u0026#34;3000\u0026#34;)}) 88 Ticket findBySeatNumberAndOnDay(Integer seatNumber, Date onDay); 89 90} 91 92@Component 93class MyService { 94 @Autowired 95 TicketRepository ticketRepository; 96 97 @Transactional 98 public Boolean bookSeat(Integer seatNumber, String personName) { 99 try { 100 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Booking seat: \u0026#34; + seatNumber + \u0026#34; By: \u0026#34; + personName); 101 Ticket seat = ticketRepository.findBySeatNumberAndOnDay(seatNumber, new Date()); 102 if (seat.getBookedBy() == null) { 103 seat.setBookedBy(personName); 104 ticketRepository.save(seat); 105 return true; 106 } else { 107 return false; 108 } 109 } catch (Exception ex) { 110 System.out.println(ex.getMessage()); 111 } 112 return false; 113 } 114 115 public void showData() { 116 ticketRepository.findAll().forEach(e -\u0026gt; { 117 System.out.println(e); 118 }); 119 } 120 121 public void seedData() { 122 ticketRepository.deleteAll(); 123 for (int i = 1; i \u0026lt;= 3; i++) { 124 ticketRepository.save(Ticket.builder().seatNumber(i).onDay(new Date()).build()); 125 } 126 } 127} Run the code and you will see that only one person is able to book the ticket.

With the arrival of time series database we can now use that data and visualize it over a period in time. Writing the integration to various monitoring systems is time consuming, hence micrometer simplifies it. Underlying metrics are exposed by Spring Boot Actuator and then Micrometer provides a facade that can be used to either push or pull metrics to monitoring systems.\nEvery meter has a name (hierarchical) and tag. There are 4 main types of meters.\nTimers - Time taken to run something. Counter - Number of time something was run. Guages - Report data when observed. Gauges can be useful when monitoring stats of cache, collections Distribution summary - Distribution of events. MeterRegistryCustomizer, you can customize the whole set of registries at once or individual implementation.\nCode 1package com.demo.project68; 2 3import io.micrometer.core.annotation.Timed; 4import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Counter; 5import io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry; 6import io.micrometer.core.instrument.Metrics; 7import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j; 8import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value; 9import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; 10import org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.metrics.MeterRegistryCustomizer; 11import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; 12import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; 13import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; 14import org.springframework.context.annotation.EnableAspectJAutoProxy; 15import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping; 16import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; 17import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController; 18 19import javax.annotation.PostConstruct; 20import java.util.Random; 21import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; 22 23@SpringBootApplication 24@Slf4j 25public class Main { 26 public static void main(String[] args) { 27 SpringApplication.run(Main.class, args); 28 } 29} 30 31@RestController 32@RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/api\u0026#34;) 33@Slf4j 34class AppController { 35 36 @Timed(\u0026#34;hello.api.time\u0026#34;) 37 @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/hello\u0026#34;) 38 public String sayHello() throws InterruptedException { 39 RegistryConfig.helloApiCounter.increment(); 40 int sleepTime = new Random().nextInt(10); 41 log.info(\u0026#34;Sleeping for seconds: {}\u0026#34;, sleepTime); 42 TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(sleepTime); 43 return \u0026#34;Hello, Sleep for \u0026#34; + sleepTime + \u0026#34; Seconds!\u0026#34;; 44 } 45} 46 47@Configuration 48@EnableAspectJAutoProxy 49class RegistryConfig { 50 51 public static Counter helloApiCounter; 52 53 @Bean 54 MeterRegistryCustomizer\u0026lt;MeterRegistry\u0026gt; configurer(@Value(\u0026#34;${spring.application.name}\u0026#34;) String applicationName) { 55 return registry -\u0026gt; registry.config().commonTags(\u0026#34;application\u0026#34;, applicationName); 56 } 57 58 @PostConstruct 59 public void postInit() { 60 helloApiCounter = Metrics.counter(\u0026#34;hello.api.count\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;); 61 } 62} 1server: 2 port: 8080 3management: 4 metrics: 5 export: 6 prometheus: 7 enabled: true 8 endpoints: 9 web: 10 exposure: 11 include: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; 12 endpoint: 13 metrics: 14 enabled: true 15 prometheus: 16 enabled: true 17 metrics.enabled: true 18spring: 19 application: 20 name: myapp 1global: 2 scrape_interval: 10s 3 scrape_timeout: 5s 4 evaluation_interval: 10s 5alerting: 6 alertmanagers: 7 - static_configs: 8 - targets: [] 9 scheme: http 10 timeout: 10s 11scrape_configs: 12 - job_name: myapp 13 scrape_interval: 10s 14 scrape_timeout: 5s 15 metrics_path: /actuator/prometheus 16 scheme: http 17 static_configs: 18 - targets: 19 - 192.168.68.104:8080 Setup Project 68 Spring Boot Micrometer - Prometheus, Wavefront\nhttps://gitorko.github.io/spring-boot-micrometer/\nVersion Check version\n1$java --version 2openjdk 17.0.3 2022-04-19 LTS Dev To run code.\n1./gradlew clean build 2./gradlew bootRun Prometheus Update the target ip-address in the prometheus.yml file, don't use localhost when using docker container\nTo start the prometheus docker instance build the docker image \u0026amp; run the image.\n1cd project68 2docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --force-rm -t my-prometheus . 3docker run -p 9090:9090 my-prometheus Grafana To start the grafana docker instance run the command.\n1docker run --name grafana -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana Dashboard - Prometheus \u0026amp; Grafana Invoke the rest api couple of times.\n1curl http://localhost:8080/api/hello Check if the metrics are returned by actuator\nhttp://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus\nYou should see metrics similar to\n1hello_api_count_total{application=\u0026#34;myapp\u0026#34;,type=\u0026#34;order\u0026#34;,} 27.0 2hello_api_time_seconds_count{application=\u0026#34;myapp\u0026#34;,exception=\u0026#34;None\u0026#34;,method=\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;,outcome=\u0026#34;SUCCESS\u0026#34;,status=\u0026#34;200\u0026#34;,uri=\u0026#34;/api/hello\u0026#34;,} 27.0 3hello_api_time_seconds_sum{application=\u0026#34;myapp\u0026#34;,exception=\u0026#34;None\u0026#34;,method=\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;,outcome=\u0026#34;SUCCESS\u0026#34;,status=\u0026#34;200\u0026#34;,uri=\u0026#34;/api/hello\u0026#34;,} 102.162818601 4hello_api_time_seconds_max{application=\u0026#34;myapp\u0026#34;,exception=\u0026#34;None\u0026#34;,method=\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;,outcome=\u0026#34;SUCCESS\u0026#34;,status=\u0026#34;200\u0026#34;,uri=\u0026#34;/api/hello\u0026#34;,} 0.0 Open Prometheus url: http://localhost:9090\nPrometheus should now start pulling data from the spring application.

Singleton Pattern Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the java virtual machine.\nA singleton class has these common features\nprivate constructor to restrict creation of instance by other classes. private static variable of the same class. public static method to get instance of class. We will first look at eager loaded singleton. This is costly as object is created at time of class loading,also no scope for exception handling if instantiation fails.\n1package com.demo.project62.singleton; 2 3public class EagerLoadedSingleton { 4 5 private static final EagerLoadedSingleton instance = new EagerLoadedSingleton(); 6 7 private EagerLoadedSingleton() { 8 } 9 10 public static void main(String[] args) { 11 System.out.println(EagerLoadedSingleton.getInstance().hello()); 12 } 13 14 public static EagerLoadedSingleton getInstance() { 15 return instance; 16 } 17 18 public String hello() { 19 return (\u0026#34;Hello from EagerLoadedSingleton!\u0026#34;); 20 } 21} This can be modified to static block singleton which provides room for handling exception.\n1package com.demo.project62.singleton; 2 3public class StaticBlockSingleton { 4 5 private static final StaticBlockSingleton instance; 6 7 static { 8 try { 9 instance = new StaticBlockSingleton(); 10 } catch (Exception e) { 11 throw new RuntimeException(\u0026#34;Exception occured in creatingsingleton instance\u0026#34;); 12 } 13 } 14 15 private StaticBlockSingleton() { 16 } 17 18 public static void main(String[] args) { 19 System.out.println(StaticBlockSingleton.getInstance().hello()); 20 } 21 22 public static StaticBlockSingleton getInstance() { 23 return instance; 24 } 25 26 public String hello() { 27 return (\u0026#34;Hello from StaticBlockSingleton!\u0026#34;); 28 } 29} The next step is to use lazy initialization singleton as creating singleton at class loading time and not using it will be costly.\n1package com.demo.project62.singleton; 2 3public class LazyLoadedSingleton { 4 5 private static LazyLoadedSingleton instance; 6 7 private LazyLoadedSingleton() { 8 } 9 10 public static void main(String[] args) { 11 System.out.println(LazyLoadedSingleton.getInstance().hello()); 12 } 13 14 public static LazyLoadedSingleton getInstance() { 15 if (instance == null) { 16 instance = new LazyLoadedSingleton(); 17 } 18 return instance; 19 } 20 21 public String hello() { 22 return (\u0026#34;Hello from LazyLoadedSingleton!\u0026#34;); 23 } 24} However this is not thread safe as in multithread environment 2 threads can get 2 different instances of the object. So lets make this thread safe. Notice we introduced synchronized keyword on the getInstance method.\n1package com.demo.project62.singleton; 2 3public class ThreadSafeSingleton { 4 5 private static ThreadSafeSingleton instance; 6 7 private ThreadSafeSingleton() { 8 } 9 10 public static void main(String[] args) { 11 System.out.println(ThreadSafeSingleton.getInstance().hello()); 12 } 13 14 public static synchronized ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance() { 15 if (instance == null) { 16 instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton(); 17 } 18 return instance; 19 } 20 21 public String hello() { 22 return (\u0026#34;Hello from ThreadSafeSingleton!\u0026#34;); 23 } 24} The above program is thread safe but reduces performance as each thread waits to enter the synchronized block. We now fix that by introducing double check locking. Notice that we removed the synchronized keyword on the getInstance method and moved it inside the method. We now perform 2 if checks on the instance.\n1package com.demo.project62.singleton; 2 3public class ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock { 4 5 private static ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock instance; 6 7 private ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock() { 8 } 9 10 public static void main(String[] args) { 11 System.out.println(ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock.getInstance().hello()); 12 } 13 14 public static ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock getInstance() { 15 if (instance == null) { 16 synchronized (ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock.class) { 17 if (instance == null) { 18 instance = new ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock(); 19 } 20 } 21 22 } 23 return instance; 24 } 25 26 public String hello() { 27 return (\u0026#34;Hello from ThreadSafeSingleton!\u0026#34;); 28 } 29} Using reflection all previous singleton implementation can be broken\n1package com.demo.project62.singleton; 2 3import java.lang.reflect.Constructor; 4import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException; 5 6public class BreakSingletonByReflection { 7 8 public static void main(String[] args) { 9 new BreakSingletonByReflection().testSingleton(); 10 } 11 12 public void testSingleton() { 13 14 ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock instanceOne = ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock.getInstance(); 15 ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock instanceTwo = null; 16 try { 17 Constructor[] constructors = ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock.class.getDeclaredConstructors(); 18 for (Constructor constructor : constructors) { 19 constructor.setAccessible(true); 20 instanceTwo = (ThreadSafeSingletonDoubleCheckLock) constructor.newInstance(); 21 break; 22 } 23 } catch (InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException | IllegalArgumentException 24 | InvocationTargetException ex) { 25 ex.printStackTrace(); 26 } 27 if (instanceOne.hashCode() != instanceTwo.hashCode()) { 28 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Singleton broken!\u0026#34;); 29 } 30 } 31} To safeguard against reflection we will throw RuntimeException in the constructor. We will introduce the volatile keyword to make it even more thread safe.\nHow volatile works in java? The volatile keyword in Java is used as an indicator to Java compiler and Thread that do not cache value of this variable and always read it from main memory. Java volatile keyword also guarantees visibility and ordering, write to any volatile variable happens before any read into the volatile variable. It also prevents compiler or JVM from the reordering of code.\nIf we do not make the instance variable volatile than the Thread which is creating instance of Singleton is not able to communicate to the other thread, that the instance has been created until it comes out of the Singleton block, so if Thread A is creating Singleton instance and just after creation lost the CPU, all other thread will not be able to see value of instance as not null and they will believe its still null. By adding volatile java will not read the variable into thread context local memory and instead read it from the main memory each time.\n1package com.demo.project62.singleton; 2 3public class SingletonDefendReflection { 4 5 private static volatile SingletonDefendReflection instance; 6 7 private SingletonDefendReflection() { 8 if (instance != null) { 9 throw new RuntimeException(\u0026#34;Use get instance to create object!\u0026#34;); 10 } 11 } 12 13 public static void main(String[] args) { 14 System.out.println(SingletonDefendReflection.getInstance().hello()); 15 } 16 17 public static SingletonDefendReflection getInstance() { 18 if (instance == null) { 19 synchronized (SingletonDefendReflection.class) { 20 if (instance == null) { 21 instance = new SingletonDefendReflection(); 22 } 23 } 24 } 25 return instance; 26 } 27 28 public String hello() { 29 return (\u0026#34;Hello from ThreadSafeSingleton!\u0026#34;); 30 } 31} To defend against reflection you can also use Enum based singleton, The disadvantage is you cant do lazy loading, you cant extend the singleton.\n1package com.demo.project62.singleton; 2 3public enum EnumSingleton { 4 5 INSTANCE; 6 7 public static void main(String[] args) { 8 System.out.println(EnumSingleton.INSTANCE.hello()); 9 } 10 11 public String hello() { 12 return (\u0026#34;Hello from EnumSingleTon!\u0026#34;); 13 } 14 15} There is another approach of writing a singleton called Bill Pugh Singleton implementation which uses static inner helper class instead of using synchronized keyword.\n1package com.demo.project62.singleton; 2 3 4public class BillPughSingleton { 5 6 private BillPughSingleton() { 7 } 8 9 public static void main(String[] args) { 10 BillPughSingleton.getInstance().hello(); 11 } 12 13 public static BillPughSingleton getInstance() { 14 return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE; 15 } 16 17 public String hello() { 18 return \u0026#34;Hello from BillPughSingleton\u0026#34;; 19 } 20 21 private static class SingletonHelper { 22 private static final BillPughSingleton INSTANCE = new BillPughSingleton(); 23 } 24} In a distributed systems a singleton needs to be serialized and restored from store later and care must be taken to ensure that new instance is not created and the same instance that was serialized is restored. Notice the method readResolve if this method is removed then the singleton design breaks during de-serialization.\n1package com.demo.project62.singleton; 2 3import java.io.FileInputStream; 4import java.io.FileOutputStream; 5import java.io.ObjectInput; 6import java.io.ObjectInputStream; 7import java.io.ObjectOutput; 8import java.io.ObjectOutputStream; 9import java.io.Serializable; 10 11public class SerializedSingleton implements Serializable { 12 13 private static final long serialVersionUID = -1L; 14 15 private SerializedSingleton() { 16 } 17 18 public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { 19 20 SerializedSingleton instanceOne = SerializedSingleton.getInstance(); 21 ObjectOutput out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\u0026#34;filename.ser\u0026#34;)); 22 out.writeObject(instanceOne); 23 out.close(); 24 25 ObjectInput in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(\u0026#34;filename.ser\u0026#34;)); 26 SerializedSingleton instanceTwo = (SerializedSingleton) in.readObject(); 27 in.close(); 28 if (instanceOne.hashCode() != instanceTwo.hashCode()) { 29 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Singleton broken!\u0026#34;); 30 } else { 31 System.out.println(instanceOne.getInstance().hello()); 32 } 33 34 } 35 36 public static SerializedSingleton getInstance() { 37 return SingletonHelper.instance; 38 } 39 40 public String hello() { 41 return (\u0026#34;Hello from singleton!\u0026#34;); 42 } 43 44 protected Object readResolve() { 45 return getInstance(); 46 } 47 48 private static class SingletonHelper { 49 private static final SerializedSingleton instance = new SerializedSingleton(); 50 } 51 52} A singleton example within java sdk is the Runtime class for garbage collection.\n1package com.demo.project62.singleton; 2 3public class RuntimeSingleton { 4 public static void main(String[] args) { 5 Runtime singleton1 = Runtime.getRuntime(); 6 singleton1.gc(); 7 Runtime singleton2 = Runtime.getRuntime(); 8 if (singleton1 == singleton2) { 9 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Singleton!\u0026#34;); 10 } else { 11 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Not Singleton!\u0026#34;); 12 } 13 } 14} Why not use a static class instead of writing a singleton class? Because static class doesnt guarantee thread safety.\nCan i have parameters in a singleton? A singleton constructor cant take parameters that violates the rule of singleton. If there are parameters then it classifies as a factory pattern.\nIf singleton is unique instance per JVM instance how does it work in a tomcat server which can have 2 instances of same web application deployed on it. Since the applications still run on single JVM will they share the singleton? In this case both web applications will get their own instance of singleton because of class loader visibility.Tomcat uses individual class loaders for webapps. However if both application request a JRE or Tomcat singleton eg: Runtime then both get the same singleton.\n2. Factory Pattern Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. The main method doesnt know the details of instantiating a object its deferred to the factory subclass. Factory calls the new operator.\n1package com.demo.project62.factory; 2 3enum AnimalType { 4 DOG, DUCK, CAT; 5} 6 7interface Animal { 8 public String sound(); 9} 10 11public class Main { 12 13 public static void main(String[] args) { 14 Animal animal = Factory.getAnimal(AnimalType.CAT); 15 System.out.println(animal.sound()); 16 } 17} 18 19class Duck implements Animal { 20 21 @Override 22 public String sound() { 23 return \u0026#34;Quak!\u0026#34;; 24 } 25} 26 27class Dog implements Animal { 28 29 @Override 30 public String sound() { 31 return \u0026#34;Bark!\u0026#34;; 32 } 33} 34 35class Cat implements Animal { 36 37 @Override 38 public String sound() { 39 return \u0026#34;Meow!\u0026#34;; 40 } 41} 42 43class Factory { 44 public static Animal getAnimal(AnimalType type) { 45 switch (type) { 46 case DOG: 47 return new Dog(); 48 case CAT: 49 return new Cat(); 50 case DUCK: 51 return new Duck(); 52 default: 53 return null; 54 } 55 } 56} 3. Abstract Factory Pattern Abstract factory pattern is similar to Factory pattern and it’s factory of factories. In factory pattern we used switch statement to decide which object to return in abstract factory we remove the if-else/switch block and have a factory class for each sub-class.\n1package com.demo.project62.abstractfactory; 2 3interface Animal { 4 public String sound(); 5} 6 7interface BaseFactory { 8 public Animal createAnimal(); 9} 10 11public class Main { 12 13 public static void main(String[] args) { 14 Animal animal = AbstractFactory.getAnimal(new DogFactory()); 15 System.out.println(animal.sound()); 16 } 17} 18 19class Duck implements Animal { 20 @Override 21 public String sound() { 22 return \u0026#34;Quak!\u0026#34;; 23 } 24} 25 26class Dog implements Animal { 27 @Override 28 public String sound() { 29 return \u0026#34;Bark!\u0026#34;; 30 } 31} 32 33class Cat implements Animal { 34 @Override 35 public String sound() { 36 return \u0026#34;Meow!\u0026#34;; 37 } 38} 39 40class AbstractFactory { 41 public static Animal getAnimal(BaseFactory bf) { 42 return bf.createAnimal(); 43 } 44} 45 46class DuckFactory implements BaseFactory { 47 @Override 48 public Animal createAnimal() { 49 return new Duck(); 50 } 51} 52 53class DogFactory implements BaseFactory { 54 @Override 55 public Animal createAnimal() { 56 return new Dog(); 57 } 58} 59 60class CatFactory implements BaseFactory { 61 @Override 62 public Animal createAnimal() { 63 return new Cat(); 64 } 65} 4. Builder Pattern Builder pattern is used to build a complex object with lot of attributes. It becomes difficult to pass the correct type in correct order to a constructor when there are many attributes. If some of the attributes are optional then there is overhead of having to pass null each time to the constructor or having to write multiple constructors(telescoping). Notice that in the example below builder pattern returns immutable object hence no setter methods exist. Notice the static inner class you can write an external class as well if you choose not to modify an existing class. Notice the private constructor of the Dog class as the only way to create an instance is via Builder. The name of dog and breed are the only mandatory fields this defines a contract that a dog object atleast needs these 2 attributes.\n1package com.demo.project62.builder; 2 3import lombok.Getter; 4import lombok.ToString; 5 6public class Main { 7 8 public static void main(String[] args) { 9 Dog dog1 = new Dog.DogBuilder(\u0026#34;rocky\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;German Sheperd\u0026#34;).setColor(\u0026#34;Grey\u0026#34;).setAge(6).setWeight(40.5).build(); 10 System.out.println(dog1); 11 Dog dog2 = new Dog.DogBuilder(\u0026#34;rocky\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;German Sheperd\u0026#34;).build(); 12 System.out.println(dog2); 13 } 14 15} 16 17@Getter 18@ToString 19class Dog { 20 21 String name; 22 String breed; 23 String color; 24 int age; 25 double weight; 26 27 private Dog(DogBuilder builder) { 28 this.name = builder.name; 29 this.breed = builder.breed; 30 this.color = builder.color; 31 this.age = builder.age; 32 this.weight = builder.weight; 33 } 34 35 @Getter 36 public static class DogBuilder { 37 38 String name; 39 String breed; 40 String color; 41 int age; 42 double weight; 43 44 public DogBuilder(String name, String breed) { 45 this.name = name; 46 this.breed = breed; 47 } 48 49 public Dog build() { 50 return new Dog(this); 51 } 52 53 public DogBuilder setColor(String color) { 54 this.color = color; 55 return this; 56 } 57 58 public DogBuilder setAge(int age) { 59 this.age = age; 60 return this; 61 } 62 63 public DogBuilder setWeight(double weight) { 64 this.weight = weight; 65 return this; 66 } 67 } 68} Output:\n1Dog(name=rocky, breed=German Sheperd, color=Grey, age=6, weight=40.5) 2Dog(name=rocky, breed=German Sheperd, color=null, age=0, weight=0.0) Using lombok @Builder annotation you can reduce the code further\n1package com.demo.project62.builder.other; 2 3import lombok.Builder; 4import lombok.Getter; 5import lombok.ToString; 6 7public class Main { 8 public static void main(String[] args) { 9 Dog dog1 = Dog.builder().name(\u0026#34;Rocky\u0026#34;).breed(\u0026#34;German Sheperd\u0026#34;).build(); 10 System.out.println(dog1); 11 } 12} 13 14@Builder 15@Getter 16@ToString 17class Dog { 18 19 String name; 20 String breed; 21 String color; 22 int age; 23 @Builder.Default 24 double weight = 30.0; 25} Output:\n1Dog(name=Rocky, breed=German Sheperd, color=null, age=0, weight=30.0) An example in the java SDK is the StringBuilder class.\n5. Prototype Pattern Prototype pattern is used when the object creation is expensive. Instead of creating a new object you can copy the original object using clone and then modify it according to your needs. Prototype design pattern mandates that the object which you are copying should provide the copying feature, it should not be done by any other class. Decision to use shallow or deep copy of the object attributes is a design decision a shallow copy just copies immediate property and deep copy copies all object references as well. Notice we dont use new to create prototype objects after the first instance is created. Prototype avoid subclassing.\n1package com.demo.project62.prototype; 2 3import java.util.ArrayList; 4import java.util.List; 5 6import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; 7import lombok.Data; 8 9public class Main { 10 11 public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException { 12 Employees emps = new Employees(new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;()); 13 emps.seedData(); 14 Employees dataSet1 = (Employees) emps.clone(); 15 Employees dataSet2 = (Employees) emps.clone(); 16 17 System.out.println(\u0026#34;dataSet1 size: \u0026#34; + dataSet1.getEmpList().size()); 18 System.out.println(\u0026#34;dataSet2 size: \u0026#34; + dataSet2.getEmpList().size()); 19 20 dataSet2.getEmpList().add(\u0026#34;jhon\u0026#34;); 21 System.out.println(\u0026#34;dataSet1 size: \u0026#34; + dataSet1.getEmpList().size()); 22 System.out.println(\u0026#34;dataSet2 size: \u0026#34; + dataSet2.getEmpList().size()); 23 } 24 25} 26 27@AllArgsConstructor 28@Data 29class Employees implements Cloneable { 30 31 private List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; empList; 32 33 public void seedData() { 34 //Invoke a remote call and fetch data and load it to list.

Provide different ways to create a class structure, using inheritance and composition to create a large object from small objects\n1. Adapter Pattern Adapter pattern is used when two unrelated interfaces need to work together. There is a AlienCraft which has different type of fire \u0026amp; scan api that takes additional parameter compared to the human readable ship interface. However by writing the adapter we map the appropriate functions for fire and scan.\n1package com.demo.project62.adapter; 2 3import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; 4 5interface Ship { 6 public void scan(); 7 8 public void fire(); 9} 10 11public class Main { 12 13 public static void main(String[] args) { 14 SpaceShipAdapter shipAdapter = new SpaceShipAdapter(new AlienCraft()); 15 shipAdapter.scan(); 16 shipAdapter.fire(); 17 } 18} 19 20class AlienCraft { 21 public void drakarys() { 22 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Firing weapon\u0026#34;); 23 } 24 25 public void jorarghugon() { 26 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Scanning enemy\u0026#34;); 27 } 28} 29 30@AllArgsConstructor 31class SpaceShipAdapter implements Ship { 32 AlienCraft ship; 33 34 @Override 35 public void scan() { 36 ship.jorarghugon(); 37 } 38 39 @Override 40 public void fire() { 41 ship.drakarys(); 42 } 43 44} Output:\n1Scanning enemy in sector NORTH 2Firing weapon at sector NORTH UML Diagram Adapter design pattern.\n2. Composite Pattern Composite pattern is used when we have to represent a part-whole hierarchy.A group of objects should behave in a similar way,tree like structure. Here we have a playlist which can contain songs or other playlist and those playlist can have songs of their own.\n1package com.demo.project62.composite; 2 3import java.util.ArrayList; 4import java.util.List; 5 6import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; 7import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor; 8 9//When the group of objects should behave as the single object 10public class Main { 11 12 public static void main(String[] args) { 13 SongComponent playlist1 = new PlayList(\u0026#34;playlist_1\u0026#34;); 14 SongComponent playlist2 = new PlayList(\u0026#34;playlist_2\u0026#34;); 15 SongComponent playlist3 = new PlayList(\u0026#34;playlist_3\u0026#34;); 16 SongComponent myplaylist = new PlayList(\u0026#34;myplaylist\u0026#34;); 17 myplaylist.add(playlist1); 18 myplaylist.add(playlist2); 19 playlist1.add(new Song(\u0026#34;Song1\u0026#34;)); 20 playlist1.add(new Song(\u0026#34;Song2\u0026#34;)); 21 playlist1.add(playlist3); 22 playlist3.add(new Song(\u0026#34;Song3\u0026#34;)); 23 24 myplaylist.displaySongInfo(); 25 } 26} 27 28abstract class SongComponent { 29 30 public void add(SongComponent c) { 31 throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); 32 } 33 34 public String getSong() { 35 throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); 36 } 37 38 public void displaySongInfo() { 39 throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); 40 } 41} 42 43@RequiredArgsConstructor 44class PlayList extends SongComponent { 45 46 final String playListName; 47 List\u0026lt;SongComponent\u0026gt; componentLst = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); 48 49 @Override 50 public void add(SongComponent c) { 51 componentLst.add(c); 52 } 53 54 @Override 55 public void displaySongInfo() { 56 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Playlist Name: \u0026#34; + playListName); 57 for (SongComponent s : componentLst) { 58 s.displaySongInfo(); 59 } 60 } 61} 62 63@AllArgsConstructor 64class Song extends SongComponent { 65 String songName; 66 67 @Override 68 public String getSong() { 69 return songName; 70 } 71 72 @Override 73 public void displaySongInfo() { 74 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Song: \u0026#34; + songName); 75 } 76} Output:\n1Playlist Name: myplaylist 2Playlist Name: playlist_1 3Song: Song1 4Song: Song2 5Playlist Name: playlist_3 6Song: Song3 7Playlist Name: playlist_2 3. Proxy Pattern Proxy pattern is used when we want to provide controlled access of a functionality. A real world example would be when a lawyer restricts the questions police would ask a mob boss. You can add only one proxy per class.\n1package com.demo.project62.proxy; 2 3interface Command { 4 public void runCommand(String cmd); 5} 6 7public class Main { 8 9 public static void main(String[] args) { 10 Proxy proxy = new Proxy(); 11 proxy.runCommand(\u0026#34;rm\u0026#34;); 12 proxy.runCommand(\u0026#34;dir\u0026#34;); 13 } 14} 15 16class CommandImpl implements Command { 17 18 @Override 19 public void runCommand(String cmd) { 20 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Running : \u0026#34; + cmd); 21 } 22} 23 24class Proxy implements Command { 25 26 Command cmdObj; 27 28 public Proxy() { 29 this.cmdObj = new CommandImpl(); 30 } 31 32 @Override 33 public void runCommand(String cmd) { 34 if (cmd.contains(\u0026#34;rm\u0026#34;)) { 35 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Cant run rm\u0026#34;); 36 } else { 37 cmdObj.runCommand(cmd); 38 } 39 } 40 41} Output:\n1Cant run rm 2Running : dir A much more generic way to doing this using default java class InvocationHandler is shown below.\n1package com.demo.project62.proxy.other; 2 3import java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler; 4import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException; 5import java.lang.reflect.Method; 6 7interface Command { 8 public void runCommand(String cmd); 9} 10 11public class Main { 12 13 public static void main(String[] args) { 14 Command cmd = (Command) CommandProxy.newInstance(new CommandImpl()); 15 cmd.runCommand(\u0026#34;ls\u0026#34;); 16 cmd.runCommand(\u0026#34;rm\u0026#34;); 17 } 18 19} 20 21class CommandImpl implements Command { 22 23 @Override 24 public void runCommand(String cmd) { 25 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Running : \u0026#34; + cmd); 26 } 27} 28 29class CommandProxy implements InvocationHandler { 30 private Object obj; 31 32 private CommandProxy(Object obj) { 33 this.obj = obj; 34 } 35 36 public static Object newInstance(Object obj) { 37 return java.lang.reflect.Proxy.newProxyInstance(obj.getClass().getClassLoader(), obj.getClass().getInterfaces(), 38 new CommandProxy(obj)); 39 } 40 41 @Override 42 public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable { 43 Object result; 44 try { 45 if (args[0].equals(\u0026#34;rm\u0026#34;)) { 46 throw new IllegalAccessException(\u0026#34;rm command not allowed\u0026#34;); 47 } else { 48 result = method.invoke(obj, args); 49 } 50 return result; 51 } catch (InvocationTargetException ex) { 52 throw ex.getTargetException(); 53 } catch (Exception ex) { 54 throw new RuntimeException(\u0026#34;invocation exception \u0026#34; + ex.getMessage()); 55 } 56 } 57 58} 4. Flyweight Pattern Flyweight pattern is used when we need to create a lot of Objects of a class eg 100,000 objects. Reduce cost of storage for large objects by sharing. When we share objects we need to determine what is intrinsic and extrinsic attributes. Here beeType is an intrinsic state and will be shared by all bees. The (x,y) coordinates are the extrinsic properties which will vary for each object. Notice that a factory pattern is also seen in the flyweight example below.\n1package com.demo.project62.flyweight; 2 3import java.util.HashMap; 4import java.util.Random; 5import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; 6 7import lombok.SneakyThrows; 8 9//divide Object property into intrinsic and extrinsic properties 10enum BeeType { 11 WORKER, ATTACKER; 12 public static BeeType getRandom() { 13 return BeeType.values()[new Random().nextInt(2)]; 14 } 15} 16 17interface Bee { 18 public void carryOutMission(int x, int y); 19} 20 21public class Main { 22 23 public static void main(String[] args) { 24 for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 100000; i++) { 25 int posx = new Random().nextInt(10); 26 int posy = new Random().nextInt(10); 27 FlyweightBeeFactory.getBeeType(BeeType.getRandom()).carryOutMission(posx, posy); 28 } 29 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Total Bee objects created:\u0026#34; + FlyweightBeeFactory.bees.size()); 30 } 31} 32 33class WorkerBee implements Bee { 34 35 @SneakyThrows 36 public WorkerBee() { 37 //Takes long time 38 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Creating worker bee!\u0026#34;); 39 TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1); 40 } 41 42 @Override 43 public void carryOutMission(int x, int y) { 44 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Depositing honey at (\u0026#34; + x + \u0026#34;,\u0026#34; + y + \u0026#34;) quadrant!\u0026#34;); 45 } 46 47} 48 49class AttackBee implements Bee { 50 51 @SneakyThrows 52 public AttackBee() { 53 //Takes long time 54 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Creating attack bee!\u0026#34;); 55 TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1); 56 } 57 58 @Override 59 public void carryOutMission(int x, int y) { 60 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Defending (\u0026#34; + x + \u0026#34;,\u0026#34; + y + \u0026#34;) quadrant!\u0026#34;); 61 } 62 63} 64 65class FlyweightBeeFactory { 66 67 public static final HashMap\u0026lt;BeeType, Bee\u0026gt; bees = new HashMap\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); 68 69 public static Bee getBeeType(BeeType beeType) { 70 Bee bee = bees.get(beeType); 71 if (bee == null) { 72 if (beeType.equals(BeeType.WORKER)) { 73 bee = new WorkerBee(); 74 } else { 75 bee = new AttackBee(); 76 } 77 bees.put(beeType, bee); 78 } 79 return bee; 80 } 81 82} Output:\n1... 2... 3WORKER_LEADER, Depositing honey at (9,50) quadrant! 4ATTACKER, Depositing honey at (75,68) quadrant! 5WORKER_LEADER, Depositing honey at (25,78) quadrant! 6Total Bee objects created:4 Now lets look at how the bad design would have looked, Here we end up creating large number of objects there by wasting memory.

Decorator Pattern Decorator design pattern is used to add the functionality by wrapping another class around the core class without modifying the core class. Disadvantage of decorator pattern is that it uses a lot of similar kind of objects.\n1package com.demo.project62.decorator; 2 3import java.math.BigDecimal; 4 5import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; 6 7public class Main { 8 9 public static void main(String[] args) { 10 Pizza pizza = new ThickCrustPizza(); 11 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Pizza: \u0026#34; + pizza.getDescription()); 12 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Cost: \u0026#34; + pizza.getCost()); 13 14 Cheese cheese = new Cheese(pizza); 15 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Pizza: \u0026#34; + cheese.getDescription()); 16 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Cost: \u0026#34; + cheese.getCost()); 17 18 Cheese doubleCheese = new Cheese(cheese); 19 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Pizza: \u0026#34; + doubleCheese.getDescription()); 20 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Cost: \u0026#34; + doubleCheese.getCost()); 21 } 22 23} 24 25interface Pizza { 26 public String getDescription(); 27 public BigDecimal getCost(); 28} 29 30class ThickCrustPizza implements Pizza { 31 32 @Override 33 public String getDescription() { 34 return \u0026#34;Thick Crust Pizza\u0026#34;; 35 } 36 37 @Override 38 public BigDecimal getCost() { 39 return new BigDecimal(10.00); 40 } 41} 42 43@AllArgsConstructor 44class PizzaToppingDecorator implements Pizza { 45 46 Pizza pizza; 47 48 @Override 49 public String getDescription() { 50 return pizza.getDescription(); 51 } 52 53 @Override 54 public BigDecimal getCost() { 55 return pizza.getCost(); 56 } 57} 58 59class Cheese extends PizzaToppingDecorator { 60 61 public Cheese(Pizza pizza) { 62 super(pizza); 63 } 64 65 @Override 66 public BigDecimal getCost() { 67 return (new BigDecimal(2.00).add(pizza.getCost())); 68 } 69 70 @Override 71 public String getDescription() { 72 return pizza.getDescription() + \u0026#34; + Cheese\u0026#34;; 73 } 74} Output:\n1Pizza: Thick Crust Pizza 2Cost: 10 3Pizza: Thick Crust Pizza + Cheese 4Cost: 12 5Pizza: Thick Crust Pizza + Cheese + Cheese 6Cost: 14 UML of Decorator Pattern\nBehavioral Design Patterns Behavioral patterns help design classes with better interaction between objects and provide lose coupling.\n1. Template Pattern Template Pattern used to create a method stub and deferring some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.

Command Pattern Command pattern is used when request is wrapped and passed to invoker which then inturn invokes the encapsulated command. Here Command is our command interface, Stock class is our request. BuyStock and SellStock implementing Order interface which does the actual command processing.\n1package com.demo.project62.command; 2 3import java.util.ArrayList; 4import java.util.List; 5 6import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; 7 8interface Command { 9 void execute(); 10} 11 12public class Main { 13 14 public static void main(String[] args) { 15 16 Stock stock1 = new Stock(\u0026#34;GOOGL\u0026#34;, 10); 17 Stock stock2 = new Stock(\u0026#34;IBM\u0026#34;, 20); 18 19 BuyStock buyStockCmd = new BuyStock(stock1); 20 SellStock sellStockCmd = new SellStock(stock2); 21 22 Broker broker = new Broker(); 23 broker.takeOrder(buyStockCmd); 24 broker.takeOrder(sellStockCmd); 25 26 broker.placeOrders(); 27 28 } 29} 30 31@AllArgsConstructor 32class Stock { 33 34 private String name; 35 private int quantity; 36 37 public void buy() { 38 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Stock [ Name: \u0026#34; + name + \u0026#34;, Quantity: \u0026#34; + quantity + \u0026#34; ] bought\u0026#34;); 39 } 40 41 public void sell() { 42 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Stock [ Name: \u0026#34; + name + \u0026#34;, Quantity: \u0026#34; + quantity + \u0026#34; ] sold\u0026#34;); 43 } 44} 45 46@AllArgsConstructor 47class BuyStock implements Command { 48 private Stock stock; 49 50 public void execute() { 51 stock.buy(); 52 } 53} 54 55@AllArgsConstructor 56class SellStock implements Command { 57 private Stock stock; 58 59 public void execute() { 60 stock.sell(); 61 } 62} 63 64class Broker { 65 private List\u0026lt;Command\u0026gt; cmdLst = new ArrayList\u0026lt;Command\u0026gt;(); 66 67 public void takeOrder(Command cmd) { 68 cmdLst.add(cmd); 69 } 70 71 public void placeOrders() { 72 for (Command cmd : cmdLst) { 73 cmd.execute(); 74 } 75 cmdLst.clear(); 76 } 77} Output:\n1Stock [ Name: GOOGL, Quantity: 10 ] bought 2Stock [ Name: IBM, Quantity: 20 ] sold 7. State Pattern State pattern is used when object changes its behaviour based on internal state. You avoid writing the conditional if-else logic to determine the type of action to be taken based on state of object. Notice that GameContext also implements State along with StartState,StopState classes.\n1package com.demo.project62.state; 2 3import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; 4import lombok.Data; 5import lombok.NoArgsConstructor; 6 7interface State { 8 public void doAction(); 9} 10 11public class Main { 12 public static void main(String[] args) { 13 GameContext game = new GameContext(); 14 15 StartState startState = new StartState(); 16 StopState stopState = new StopState(); 17 18 game.setState(startState); 19 game.doAction(); 20 21 game.setState(stopState); 22 game.doAction(); 23 } 24 25} 26 27class StartState implements State { 28 29 public void doAction() { 30 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Roll the dice!\u0026#34;); 31 } 32} 33 34class StopState implements State { 35 36 public void doAction() { 37 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Game Over!\u0026#34;); 38 } 39} 40 41@AllArgsConstructor 42@NoArgsConstructor 43@Data 44class GameContext implements State { 45 private State state; 46 47 @Override 48 public void doAction() { 49 this.state.doAction(); 50 } 51} Output:\n1Roll the dice! 2Game Over! 8. Visitor Pattern Visitor pattern is used to add methods to different types of classes without altering those classes.

Iterator Pattern Iterator pattern is used to provide standard way to traverse through group of objects. In the example below we provide 2 types of iterators over the fruit collection, we could have let the user write his own iterator but if there are many clients using the iterator then it would be difficult to maintain. Notice that FruitIterator is private and inner class, this hides the implementation details from the client. Logic of iteration is internal to the collection.\n1package com.demo.project62.iterator; 2 3import java.util.ArrayList; 4import java.util.Collections; 5import java.util.Comparator; 6import java.util.Iterator; 7import java.util.List; 8 9import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; 10import lombok.Data; 11 12interface FruitCollection { 13 public Iterator getIterator(String type); 14} 15 16public class Main { 17 public static void main(String[] args) { 18 19 FruitCollectionImpl collection = new FruitCollectionImpl(); 20 21 for (Iterator iter = collection.getIterator(\u0026#34;COLOR\u0026#34;); iter.hasNext(); ) { 22 Fruit fruit = (Fruit) iter.next(); 23 System.out.println(fruit); 24 } 25 System.out.println(\u0026#34;-------------------------------\u0026#34;); 26 for (Iterator iter = collection.getIterator(\u0026#34;TYPE\u0026#34;); iter.hasNext(); ) { 27 Fruit fruit = (Fruit) iter.next(); 28 System.out.println(fruit); 29 } 30 } 31} 32 33@AllArgsConstructor 34@Data 35class Fruit { 36 String type; 37 String color; 38} 39 40class FruitCollectionImpl implements FruitCollection { 41 42 List\u0026lt;Fruit\u0026gt; fruits; 43 44 FruitCollectionImpl() { 45 fruits = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); 46 fruits.add(new Fruit(\u0026#34;Banana\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Green\u0026#34;)); 47 fruits.add(new Fruit(\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Green\u0026#34;)); 48 fruits.add(new Fruit(\u0026#34;Banana\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Yellow\u0026#34;)); 49 fruits.add(new Fruit(\u0026#34;Cherry\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Red\u0026#34;)); 50 fruits.add(new Fruit(\u0026#34;Apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Red\u0026#34;)); 51 } 52 53 @Override 54 public Iterator getIterator(String type) { 55 if (type.equals(\u0026#34;COLOR\u0026#34;)) { 56 return new FruitIterator(\u0026#34;COLOR\u0026#34;); 57 } else { 58 return new FruitIterator(\u0026#34;TYPE\u0026#34;); 59 } 60 } 61 62 private class FruitIterator implements Iterator { 63 int index; 64 List\u0026lt;Fruit\u0026gt; sortedFruits = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(fruits); 65 66 FruitIterator(String iteratorType) { 67 if (iteratorType.equals(\u0026#34;COLOR\u0026#34;)) { 68 Collections.sort(sortedFruits, Comparator.comparing(Fruit::getColor)); 69 } else { 70 Collections.sort(sortedFruits, Comparator.comparing(Fruit::getType)); 71 } 72 } 73 74 @Override 75 public boolean hasNext() { 76 if (index \u0026lt; sortedFruits.size()) { 77 return true; 78 } 79 return false; 80 } 81 82 @Override 83 public Object next() { 84 if (this.hasNext()) { 85 return sortedFruits.get(index++); 86 } 87 return null; 88 } 89 } 90 91} Output:\n1Fruit(type=Banana, color=Green) 2Fruit(type=Apple, color=Green) 3Fruit(type=Cherry, color=Red) 4Fruit(type=Apple, color=Red) 5Fruit(type=Banana, color=Yellow) 6------------------------------- 7Fruit(type=Apple, color=Green) 8Fruit(type=Apple, color=Red) 9Fruit(type=Banana, color=Green) 10Fruit(type=Banana, color=Yellow) 11Fruit(type=Cherry, color=Red) 11. Memento Pattern Memento pattern is used to restore state of an object to a previous state.\nMemento pattern involves three classes.\nOriginator: The core class which holds a state. This state will need to be reverted to previous states. Think of this as your text editor text data. Memento: The class has all the same attributes as Originator class and is used to hold values that will be restored back to the Originator class. Think of this as a temporary variable. Each time you click on save a memento is created and added to the list so that it can be reverted later. CareTaker - This class takes ownership of creating and restoring memento. In the example below you can create a Originator object and change its state many times, only when you call the CareTaker.save method a memento gets created so that an undo operation later on can revert to that state. The list mementoList is private so only caretaker has access to the memento objects ensuring integrity of data. Take special care if the attribute is immutable in the undoState method.\n1package com.demo.project62.memento; 2 3import java.util.ArrayList; 4import java.util.List; 5 6import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; 7import lombok.Data; 8import lombok.NoArgsConstructor; 9import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor; 10 11public class Main { 12 13 public static void main(String[] args) { 14 15 Originator originator = new Originator(); 16 CareTaker careTaker = new CareTaker(originator); 17 careTaker.save(); 18 19 originator.setState(\u0026#34;State #1\u0026#34;); 20 originator.setState(\u0026#34;State #2\u0026#34;); 21 careTaker.save(); 22 23 originator.setState(\u0026#34;State #3\u0026#34;); 24 careTaker.save(); 25 26 originator.setState(\u0026#34;State #4\u0026#34;); 27 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Current State: \u0026#34; + originator.getState()); 28 29 careTaker.undo(); 30 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Current State: \u0026#34; + originator.getState()); 31 32 careTaker.undo(); 33 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Current State: \u0026#34; + originator.getState()); 34 35 careTaker.undo(); 36 careTaker.undo(); 37 careTaker.undo(); 38 System.out.println(\u0026#34;Current State: \u0026#34; + originator.getState()); 39 } 40} 41 42@Data 43@AllArgsConstructor 44class Memento { 45 private String state; 46} 47 48@Data 49@AllArgsConstructor 50@NoArgsConstructor 51class Originator { 52 private String state; 53 54 public Memento saveState() { 55 return new Memento(this.state); 56 } 57 58 public void undoState(Memento memento) { 59 this.state = memento.getState(); 60 } 61 62} 63 64@RequiredArgsConstructor 65class CareTaker { 66 final Originator origin; 67 private List\u0026lt;Memento\u0026gt; mementoList = new ArrayList\u0026lt;Memento\u0026gt;(); 68 69 public void save() { 70 if (origin.getState() != null) { 71 mementoList.add(origin.saveState()); 72 } 73 } 74 75 public void undo() { 76 if (!mementoList.isEmpty()) { 77 origin.undoState(mementoList.get(mementoList.size() - 1)); 78 mementoList.remove(mementoList.size() - 1); 79 } 80 } 81} Output:\n1Current State: State #4 2Current State: State #3 3Current State: State #2 4Current State: State #2 Differences 1. Difference between bridge pattern and adapter pattern Bridge pattern is built upfront you break things at design time to make changes so that functionality can be added without tight coupling, adapter pattern works after code is already designed like legacy code.\n2. Difference between mediator pattern and observer pattern In observer, many objects are interested in the state change of one object. They are not interested in each other. So the relation is one to many. In mediator, many objects are interested to communicate many other objects. Here the relation is many to many.\n3. Difference between chain of responsibility and command pattern In chain of responsibility pattern, the request is passed to potential receivers, whereas the command pattern uses a command object that encapsulates a request.\n4. Difference between adapter pattern and decorator pattern Adapter pattern only adapts functionality, decorator adds more functionality.\n5. Difference between adapter pattern and facade pattern Adapter pattern just links two incompatible interfaces. A facade is used when one wants an easier or simpler interface to work with.\n","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/post/design-patterns/","section":"post","tags":["design-pattern"],"title":"Design Patterns"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/categories/java/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Java"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/tags/xenon/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"xenon"},{"body":"Simple rest service using VMWare Xenon Framework. We will deploy multi-node instance of the rest service and explore the xenon UI.\nXenon Xenon is a framework for writing small REST-based services. When you write a rest service in other frameworks like spring you have to pick a data store like mongo db to persist your data, you have to maintain separate instances of mongo db to ensure replication works. You have to then deploy your rest service on distributed environment using docker swarm and ensure high availability of your service. Xenon framework does all this for you with just a single library. Here we will see how to create a simple rest service using xenon and then see how we can achieve asynchronous call,distributed node deployment, replication, synchronization, ordering, and consistency of data across those nodes. We will see how we can scale the application etc.\nCreate a simple maven project.

The data replication will be shared among the nodes that have ServiceOption.OWNER_SELECTION enabled. By enabling this you are telling the service that this node will take ownership of storing the data. So if there are 3 nodes in the poll then each node will store 1/3 of the 1 million records in the data store, if one of the node goes down then rebalancing happens and now the 2 nodes each have 1/2 of the 1 million records. When you request hits a server which doesnt have that data stored locally the request then gets forwarded to the node which is the owner of that data. You can have few nodes within the pool with ServiceOption.OWNER_SELECTION disabled they will internally forward the requests to the OWNER nodes.\nMutlinode Multi node capability in xenon provides high availability \u0026amp; scalability in terms of storage \u0026amp; request processing.\nStateful Service vs Stateless Service What we wrote above is a stateful rest service. A stateful service invovles data that needs persistence. An example of a stateless rest service would be a proxy service.\nReplication factor \u0026amp; Quorum The replication factor tells xenon how many nodes the stateful service needs to be replicated over. Default is all. Quroum tells xenon on how many nodes the persist operation should be successful before considering something as persisted. If you have defined quorum of 3 nodes and 1 node fails then all future write requests to will fail as there arent enough members to validate the quorum. Default is majority quorum [n/2+1] where n is replication factor. On a 3 node with replication factor all, quorum is [3/2+1] = 2 which means 2 nodes have to agree for a write to be committed.\nServiceOption Description PERSISTENCE persists data REPLICATION replicates data across nodes INSTRUMENTATION provides stats about service OWNER_SELECTION takes ownership of storing data PropertyUsageOption Annotation Description ID id field AUTO_MERGE_IF_NOT_NULL helper method will merge current state with state supplied in body in case of updates OPTIONAL not optional REQUIRED mandatory field SERVICE_USE used internally Now let us deploy our service in a distributed environment. Delete the test folder as we wont be covering it here. Run the command\n1$ mvn clean install 2 3$ cd target; 4 5$ java -jar myxenon-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar This should start the single node instance of your book store rest service.\nNow lets add 2 more nodes to the quorum. All the 3 nodes (\u0026quot;Service Host\u0026quot;) will form what is called a node group. Replication happens within this node group.\n1$ java -jar myxenon-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --port=8001 --peerNodes=http://localhost:8000 2$ java -jar myxenon-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --port=8002 --peerNodes=http://localhost:8000 It will take a few seconds for the nodes to synchronize/converge, the nodes use gossip to detect changes and identify new members in group.. Note: The node name should be unique in the quorum. There must be minimum 3 nodes. You should be able to see all 3 nodes in the UI. You can try shutting down the primary node and see if data is still accessible. A node group identifies which node is the owner of the data and forwards request to the owner to retrieve that.\nYou can also add a node to a group after its started, you can do this by invoking a rest call (JoinPeerRequest). For now we will use the option of adding node to node group at startup time by providing --peerNodes. Such an ability to join a node group will be very useful in IOT based devices.\n1curl -X GET -H \u0026#39;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#39; -i http://localhost:8001/myservice/books/e948dec6a69bdd3f57182b45a6740 Clicking on the http://localhost:8000/core/ui/default/#/main/service/id__myservice_books should show up more details on the record. You can edit/delete records from the UI as well.\nYou can also query for your data in the query tab.\nReferences Xenon\nXenon Github\n","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/post/xenon-rest-service-framework/","section":"post","tags":["xenon"],"title":"Xenon Rest Service Framework"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitorko.github.io/tags/index/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"index"}]
